<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">This prospectus relates to
the resale, from time to time, by the selling shareholder (&ldquo;Selling Shareholder&rdquo;) identified in this prospectus of up to 159,106
of our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares, par value US$0.40 per share (&ldquo;Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares&rdquo;) which includes (i) 59,106
Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares that were issued to the Selling Shareholder pursuant to the terms of the Confidential Settlement Agreement
and Release, dated December 10, 2025, by and between CorProminence, LLC d/b/a Core IR and the Company (the &ldquo;Settlement Agreement&rdquo;);
and (ii) 100,000 True-up Shares (as defined below).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement, the Company issued 59,106 Class A Ordinary Shares to the Selling Shareholder at $3.13 per share (representing $185,000 in aggregate
proceeds). The Settlement Agreement contains a true-up provision whereby, if the Selling Shareholder sells these shares and receives proceeds
less than $185,000, the Company will issue additional Class A Ordinary Shares to make up the shortfall (the &ldquo;True-up Share&rdquo;).
The number of additional shares issuable under the true-up provision is contingent on the market price of the Class A Ordinary Shares
at the time the Selling Shareholder elects to sell. &#8203; For illustrative purposes: (i) if our share price declines to $2.00, we will
issue approximately 33,394 True-up Shares; or (ii) if our share price declines to $1.50, we will issue approximately 64,228 True-up Shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We are registering a total
of 100,000 True-up Shares, which we believe is a conservative estimation and will be sufficient to cover our true-up obligations in the
event our share price declines to approximately $1.16 per share, representing a potential 64% decline from the closing price of $3.19
on January 12, 2026. While we do not forecast a decline to $1.16, we are registering True-up Shares at this conservative threshold to
ensure adequate coverage for true-up obligations across a range of foreseeable adverse scenarios. Should our share price decline below
$1.16 per share at the time of the Selling Shareholder&rsquo;s resale, we would need to file an additional registration statement to cover
additional true-up shares beyond the 100,000 registered herein. Conversely, if the market price remains at $3.19 or appreciates, no true-up
issuance may be necessary. The registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part registers both the initial 59,106 Class A
Ordinary Shares and the estimated 100,000 true-up shares for resale by the Selling Shareholder.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Currently, we are not aware
there are any material restrictions on foreign exchange, the ability to transfer cash between our entities, or the ability to distribute
earnings to investors outside of China. Further, we are aware that recently, the Chinese government recently initiated a series of regulatory
actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities
in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using entity variable interest entity (&ldquo;VIE&rdquo;)
structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement.
Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making
bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated,
if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our operations given that we have clients from
Mainland China, the ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S.&nbsp;or other foreign exchange. Any future action by the
Chinese government expanding the categories of industries and companies whose foreign securities offerings are subject to government review
could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and could cause the value
of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. For a detailed description of the risks related to our business, see &ldquo;Risk
Factors&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;Risks Related to Doing Business in China and Hong&nbsp;Kong.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">On December&nbsp;16,
2021, the United&nbsp;States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, issued a Determination Report which found that the
PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (i)&nbsp;China, and
(ii)&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong. Enrome LLP, our auditor, is not identified in the 2021 PCAOB Report as a firm subject to the PCAOB&rsquo;s
determination. While our auditor is headquartered in Singapore and is registered with PCAOB and subject to PCAOB inspection, in the
event it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor because of a position taken
by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction On August&nbsp;26, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it had signed a Statement of Protocol
(the &ldquo;Protocol&rdquo;)  with the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance (&ldquo;MOF&rdquo;) of the
People&rsquo;s Republic of China, which governs inspections and investigations of audit firms based in mainland China and
Hong&nbsp;Kong. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the Protocol released by the SEC, the PCAOB shall have independent
discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and the unfettered ability to transfer information to the
SEC.&nbsp;According to the PCAOB, its December&nbsp;2021 determinations under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or
HFCAA, remain in effect. On December&nbsp;15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and
investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong in 2022, and the PCAOB Board
vacated its previous determinations that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting
firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong. It is possible when the PCAOB may reassess its determinations in the
future, and it could determine that it is still unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms in
mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong. On December&nbsp;23, 2022 the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
(&ldquo;AHFCAA&rdquo;) was enacted, which amended the HFCAA by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer&rsquo;s securities from
trading on any U.S.&nbsp;stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive&nbsp;years instead
of three. On December&nbsp;29, 2022, a legislation entitled &ldquo;Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023&rdquo; (the
&ldquo;Consolidated Appropriations Act&rdquo;), was signed into law by President Biden. The Consolidated Appropriations Act
contained, among other things, an identical provision to AHFCAA, which reduces the number of consecutive non-inspection&nbsp;years
required for triggering the prohibitions under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act from three&nbsp;years to two. Whether
the PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered
in mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong is subject to uncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of our, and our
auditor&rsquo;s, control. The PCAOB is continuing to demand complete access in mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong moving forward and
is already making plans to resume regular inspections in early 2023 and beyond, as well as to continue pursuing ongoing
investigations and initiate new investigations as needed. The PCAOB has indicated that it will act immediately to consider the need
to issue new determinations with the HFCAA if needed, without having to wait another year to reassess its determinations. In the
future, if there is any regulatory change or step taken by PRC regulators that does not permit our auditor to provide audit
documentations located in China or Hong&nbsp;Kong to the PCAOB for inspection or investigation, or the PCAOB expands the scope of
the determination so that we are subject to the HFCAA, as the same may be amended, you may be deprived of the benefits of such
inspection which could result in limitation or restriction to our access to the U.S.&nbsp;capital markets and trading of our
securities, including trading on the national exchange and trading on &ldquo;over-the-counter&rdquo; markets, may be prohibited
under the HFCAA.</P>

development and improvement of sales channels. Changes in any of the above at any time could result in decline in consumer demand for
our products. Our business development will depend partially on our ability to (i)&nbsp;anticipate, identify or adapt to such changes,

downward pressure on sales and pricing of our products or lead to increases in selling and distribution expenses, and therefore materially

For example, we may not be able to expand further in some overseas markets if we are not able to adapt our products to fit the needs of

applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing business. We may be unable to keep current with changes
in laws and regulations as they occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these
laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we or our employees, partners, and agents will always maintain compliance. Any violations
could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable
to comply with these laws and regulations or manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease
operations in certain foreign jurisdictions, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Additionally, the global macroeconomic
environment is facing challenges. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has brought about an adverse impact on global economies
and financial markets. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted
by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world&rsquo;s leading economies, including the United&nbsp;States and China.
There have been concerns over unrest and terrorist threats in the Middle East, Europe and Africa and over the conflicts involving Ukraine,
Syria and North Korea. There have also been concerns on the relationship among China and other Asian countries, which may result in or
intensify potential conflicts in relation to territorial disputes, and the trade disputes between the United&nbsp;States and China. The
ongoing trade tensions between the United&nbsp;States and China may have tremendous negative impact on the economies of not merely the
two countries concerned, but the global economy as a whole. It is unclear whether these challenges and uncertainties will be contained
or resolved, and what effects they may have on the global political and economic conditions in the long term. Our international market
expansion strategy may be hindered if these challenges and uncertainties persist.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">To the extent permitted
due to our recurring losses from operations and an accumulated deficit, we have begun to expand our business internationally in the
United&nbsp;States. and Southeast Asia through online and offline sales channels, including accessing overseas markets through
third-party e-commerce platforms and local distributors. However, we may not be able to expand our business as we planned. For
example, we may not be able to identify e-commerce platforms or local distributors with sufficient resources and strong local ties
to collaborate with us, which would negatively affect our strategy to expand our business to international markets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Expanding our business outside
the PRC also involves certain risks and uncertainties, such as our ability to obtain adequate funding for development and expansion costs,
identify strategic markets globally, identify locations with large consumer base and commercial potential, obtain the required licenses,
permits and approvals, and recruit and retain talents with sufficient experience. Any risks and uncertainties listed above, either individually
or in aggregate, might delay or fail our plan to expand our business overseas at manageable cost levels.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">In addition to the above factors,
our overseas expansions face additional difficulties and challenges. We have limited experience operating in overseas markets and may
face competition from major, established competitors in these markets. These competitors usually have more experience and resources for
their business operations in those markets. In addition, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory,
and other operating requirements in these markets differ significantly from those in China. Moreover, a number of factors could have an
adverse impact on our operating results if our efforts to expand internationally are not successful. These factors include changes in
market needs and product trends, economic fluctuations, political and social turbulence, relevant countries or regions&rsquo; relationships
with China, changes in legal regulations or other conditions and difficulties in employing and training appropriate local management and
employees. There is no assurance that our international market expansion strategy will succeed in the future.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We aim to bring to consumers
affordable, healthy, and convenient food products. The pricing of our products is based on multiple factors, including, without limitation,
the pricing of the components, ingredients and raw materials, costs of product development, anticipated sales volume, manufacturing costs
and logistics service expenditures. Benefiting from our deep engagement with our customers, we are in a good position to analyze consumers&rsquo;
preferences and demands, evaluate the market acceptance and potential sales volume of our new products to be launched, which enables us
to price our products at a competitive rate. Nevertheless, we cannot ascertain that we will adopt a competitive pricing strategy for our
products at all times. If we price our products too low, our profit margin will suffer. If we price our products higher than consumers&rsquo;
expected price, we may not achieve the sales volume we expect, in which case revenues from the corresponding products may be negatively
affected.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Even if we properly price our
products at their launch time, we may need to offer substantial discounts, especially during the major shopping festivals such as &ldquo;618,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Singles&rsquo; Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;Double Twelve,&rdquo; to promote our brand awareness and to drive sales volume, or cut down
the price as our products advance in their life cycles to maintain such products&rsquo; attractiveness to consumers. We may also need
to reduce the prices to sell excess inventory in the event that we fail to accurately forecast demands. Any such price cuts may not lead
to the sales volume we expect and may negatively impact the demand for our other newly launched or higher-end products, in which case
our revenues could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, some customers may purchase our products in bulk when we offer substantially discounted
or promotional prices and then re-sell them through their proprietary or third-party channels. The market and pricing for our products
may be interrupted by the secondary sale pricing strategies adopted by such resellers and the possible negative shopping experience they
provide to consumers, which may negatively impact our brand image and our business.</P>

maintaining and enhancing the reputation of our brands is of significant importance to the success of our business and that our
financial success is directly dependent on consumer perception of our brands. Well-recognized brands are important to enhancing our
attractiveness to consumers. Since we operate in a highly competitive market, brand maintenance and enhancement directly affect our
ability to maintain our market position. As a young company, our brand awareness among consumers may not be as strong as the more
established food brands, and maintaining and enhancing the recognition and reputation of our brand is critical to our business and
future growth.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Our ability to maintain our
reputation and brands is affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include our ability to provide
a satisfactory consumer experience, which in turn depends on our ability to bring products to the market at competitive prices that respond
to consumer demands and preferences, our ability and that of our manufacturing and service partners to comply with ethical and social
standards and various and evolving rules and standards related to product quality and safety, labor and environmental protection, our
ability to produce safe and healthy products, our ability to provide satisfactory order fulfilment services, and our ability to provide
responsive and superior customer services. Failure to succeed in any of these areas could damage our customer experience, our reputation
and brand image and our ability to retain and attract customers. The success of our brand may also suffer if our marketing plans or product
initiatives do not have the desired impact on our brand&rsquo;s image or its ability to attract consumers. If we are unable to conduct
our sales and marketing efforts in a cost-effective and efficient manner, our results of operations and financial conditions may be materially
and adversely affected.&rdquo; We cannot assure you, however, that these activities are and will be successful or that we can achieve
the brand promotion effect we expect. If we are unable to preserve our reputation, enhance our brand recognition or increase positive
awareness of our products, it may be difficult for us to maintain and grow our consumer base, and our business, financial condition and
results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.</P>

our third-party manufacturers or raw material suppliers to comply with food safety, ethical, social, product, labor and environmental
laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact our reputations and lead to various adverse consequences, including decreased sales
and consumer boycotts. Also, we may face customer complaints or negative publicity about us, our products, our management, our business
partners or the KOLs we collaborate with from time to time, which may
adversely affect our brand, reputation and business and diminish the appeal of our brand to consumers. Certain of such negative publicity
may come from malicious harassment or unfair acts by third parties or our competitors, which are beyond our control.</P>

be defectively designed, manufactured or of quality issue, or cause harm and adverse effect to the health of our customers. The offerings
of such products by us may expose us to liabilities associated with consumer protection laws. Pursuant to the Law of PRC on the Protection
of Rights and Interests of Consumers (the &ldquo;Consumer Protection Law&rdquo;), business operators must guarantee that the commodities
they sell satisfy the requirements for personal or property safety, provide consumers with authentic information about the commodities,
and guarantee the quality, function, usage and term of validity, etc. of the commodities. Failure to comply with the Consumer Protection
Law may subject business operators to civil liabilities such as refunding purchase prices, replacement of commodities, repairing, ceasing
damages, compensation, and restoring reputation, and even subject the business operators to criminal penalties when personal damages are
involved or if the circumstances are severe. Although we would have legal recourse against the manufacturer of such products under PRC
law if the liabilities are attributable to the manufacturer, attempting to enforce our rights against the manufacturer may be expensive,
time-consuming and ultimately futile.</P>

operations, which may increase such risk. New illnesses resistant to any precautions or diseases with long incubation periods could
arise on a retroactive basis. Reports in the media of instances of food-borne illnesses could, if highly publicized, negatively
affect our industry and us. This risk exists even if it were  later determined that the illness in fact were
not spread by our products. We also face risks related to health epidemics. Past occurrences of epidemics or pandemics, depending on
their scale of occurrence, have caused different degrees of damage to the national and local economies in China. An outbreak of any
epidemics or pandemics in China may adversely affect the local economy and willingness to spend in local areas and result in a
decrease in the number of our customers in such areas. Any of the above may cause material disruptions to our operations, which in
turn may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and may continue to affect the demand
for our products, our business operations and financial conditions. Our operations are also vulnerable to natural disasters and
other catastrophic events, including wars, terrorist attacks, earthquakes, typhoons, fires, floods, extreme high temperature events,
power failures and shortages, water shortages, information system failures, and similar events that may or may not be
foreseeable.</P>

by its Amendment 7 (effective on February&nbsp;28, 2009) and Amendment&nbsp;9 (effective on November&nbsp;1, 2015), prohibits any person
from selling or providing a citizen&rsquo;s personal information obtained during the course of performing duties or providing services,
or obtaining such information through theft or other illegal ways. On November&nbsp;7, 2016, the SCNPC issued the Cyber Security Law of
the PRC, or the Cyber Security Law, which became effective on June&nbsp;1, 2017. Pursuant to the Cyber Security Law, network operators
must not, without users&rsquo; consent, collect their personal information, and may only collect users&rsquo; personal information necessary
to provide their services. Providers are also obliged to provide security maintenance for their products and services and shall comply
with provisions regarding the protection of personal information as stipulated under the relevant laws and regulations. The Civil Code
of the PRC (issued by the PRC National People&rsquo;s Congress on May&nbsp;28, 2020 and effective from January&nbsp;1, 2021) provides
main legal basis for privacy and personal information infringement claims under the Chinese civil laws. PRC regulators, including the
Cyberspace Administration of China, MIIT, and the Ministry of Public Security have been increasingly focusing on regulation in the areas
of data security and data protection. The PRC regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity are constantly evolving. For instance, various
regulatory bodies in China, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Public Security and State Administration
for Market Regulation, or the SAMR, have enforced data privacy and protection laws and regulations with varying and evolving standards
and interpretations. On November&nbsp;14, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China, or the CAC, issued the Draft Cyber Data Security
Regulations for public comments, pursuant to which, data processors carrying out the following activities must, in accordance with the
relevant national regulations, apply for a cybersecurity review: (i)&nbsp;the merger, reorganization or spin-off of internet platform
operators that possess a large number of data resources related to national security, economic development and public interests that affects
or may affect national security; (ii)&nbsp;listing in a foreign country of data processors that process the personal information of more
than one million users; (iii)&nbsp;listing in Hong&nbsp;Kong of data processors that affect or may affect national security; and (iv)&nbsp;other
data processing activities that affect or may affect national security. The scope of and threshold for determining what &ldquo;affects
or may affect national security&rdquo; is still subject to uncertainty and further elaboration by the CAC.&nbsp;On December&nbsp;28, 2021,
the CAC, and 12&nbsp;other relevant PRC government
authorities published the amended Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on February&nbsp;15, 2022. The final Cybersecurity
Review Measures provide that a &ldquo;network platform operator&rdquo; that possesses personal information of more than one million users
and seeks a listing in a foreign country must apply for a cybersecurity review. Further, the relevant PRC governmental authorities may
initiate a cybersecurity review against any company if they determine certain network products, services or data processing activities
of such company affect or may affect national security. Through the contractual arrangements with Shanghai Weishi Information Technology
Co., Ltd. (&ldquo;Weishi&rdquo;), Shanghai DayDayCook Information Technology Co., Ltd. (&ldquo;DDC Shanghai&rdquo;) had collected and
possessed personal information of more than one million users. After the contractual arrangements with Weishi were terminated in April&nbsp;2022,
DDC Shanghai still have been possessing this amount of personal information which are stored in mainland China. For purposes of the Cybersecurity
Review Measures, we have applied for and completed the cybersecurity review with respect to our proposed overseas listing pursuant to
the Cybersecurity Review Measures.</P>

protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development, as well as the degree of harm it will cause to national
security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations when such data is tampered with, destroyed,
leaked, or illegally acquired or used. The PRC Data Security Law also provides for a national security review procedure for data activities
that may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data and information. As uncertainties remain regarding the
interpretation and implementation of these laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will comply with such regulations in all
respects and we may be ordered to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities. We may also become

SCNPC promulgated the PRC Personal Information Protection Law, or the PIPL, which took effect in November&nbsp;2021. In addition to other
rules and principles of personal information processing, the PIPL specifically provides rules for processing sensitive personal information.
Sensitive personal information refers to personal information that, once leaked or illegally used, could easily lead to the infringement
of human dignity or harm to the personal or property safety of an individual, including biometric recognition, religious belief, specific
identity, medical and health, financial account, personal whereabouts and other information of an individual, as well as any personal
information of a minor under the age of 14. Only where there is a specific purpose and sufficient necessity, and under circumstances where
strict protection measures are taken, may personal information processors process sensitive personal information. A personal information
processor shall inform the individual of the necessity of processing such sensitive personal information and the impact thereof on the
individual&rsquo;s rights and interests apart from the matters of, including without limitation, name and contact number of the processor,
processing purpose and method, type to be processed, preservation period of the information, means and procedures by which individuals
exercise the rights provided by the PIPL.&nbsp;As uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of the PIPL, we
cannot assure you that we will comply with the PIPL in all respects and regulatory authorities may order us to rectify or terminate our
current practice of collecting and processing sensitive personal information.</P>

successfully against larger and better-funded sales and marketing campaigns of some of our current or future competitors, especially if
these competitors provide their distributors with more favorable arrangements. We cannot assure you that we will not lose any of our distributors
to our competitors, which could cause us to lose some or all of our favorable arrangements with such distributors and may result in the
termination of our relationships with other distributors. In addition, we may not be able to successfully manage our distributors and
the cost of any consolidation or further expansion of our distribution and sales network may exceed the revenue generated from these efforts.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in detecting any non-compliance by our distributors with the provisions of their
distribution agreements. Non-compliance by our distributors could, among other things, negatively affect our brand, demand for our products
and our relationships with other distributors. Furthermore, if the sales volumes of our products to consumers are not maintained at a
satisfactory level or if distributor orders fail to track consumers demand, our distributors may not place orders for new products from
us, or decrease the quantity of their usual orders. The occurrence of any of these factors could result in a significant decrease in the
sales volume of our products and therefore adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.</P>

in China and the United&nbsp;States, in particular the RTC and RTE food industry, which is highly competitive, and the competition may

greater financial, research and development and other resources than us. We also cannot assure you that our current or potential competitors
will not market products comparable or superior to those we provide or adapt more quickly to evolving industry trends or changing market
demand. Our competitors in certain regional markets may also benefit from raw material sources or production facilities that are closer
to these markets. It is also possible that there will be a consolidation trend in the RTC, RTE and plant-based food industry, integration
of upstream and downstream businesses or alliances among competitors; and as a result, our competitors may rapidly acquire significant
market share. Any of these events may cause our market share, business and results of operations to be adversely affected.</P>

behavior. We cannot guarantee that our marketing efforts will be sufficient to compete with our competitors. An increase in competition
could require us to continue to increase our promotion and advertising expenses, which might place pressure on our margins and affect
our profitability. Additionally, competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market shares for us, any of
which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We also cannot assure you that our competitors will not actively engage
in activities, whether legal or illegal, designed to undermine our brands and product quality or to influence consumer confidence in our

we enter new markets, or enter new sales channels, including social media and e-commerce channels. New markets and sales channels may
have different regulatory requirements, competitive conditions, consumer preferences and different spending patterns from our existing
markets and sales channels. Consumers in new markets and sales channels are likely to be unfamiliar with our brands and products and we
may need to build or increase brand awareness in the relevant markets and sales channels by increasing investments in advertising and
promotional activities than we originally planned. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, train and retain qualified employees
who share our business philosophy and culture. In addition, we may have difficulty in finding reliable suppliers with adequate supplies
of raw materials meeting our quality standards or distributors with efficient distribution networks. As a result, any products we introduce
in new markets may be more expensive to produce and/or distribute and may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels than in
our existing markets, which could affect the viabilities of these new operations or our overall profitability.</P>

major e-commerce platforms and online distributors. Our development of the e-commerce channel depends on many factors, most of which are
beyond our control, including: the trust and confidence level of China&rsquo;s online consumers, as well as changes in consumer consumption
patterns, tastes and preferences; the growth of internet usage in China; and the development of fulfillment, payment and other ancillary
services associated with e-commerce sales. Any failure to respond to trends and consumer requirements in the e-commerce channel may adversely
affect our sales and our business and growth prospects in this sales channel.</P>

on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational, financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to
expand, train, motivate and manage our workforce. We cannot assure you that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate
to support our future growth. Failure to effectively manage our expansion may lead to increased costs and reduced profitability and may
adversely affect our growth prospects. In addition, as we expand our operations, we may encounter regulatory, personnel and other difficulties
that may also increase our costs of operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We source a majority of
our products from suppliers located in China and the United&nbsp;States, and our suppliers source raw materials and packaging
materials within China and the United&nbsp;States. Raw materials used within the production process include, for example, meat,
rice, oil, soy beans, starch and sugar. To date, inflationary pressures have not materially impacted the cost of sourcing our
products. However, raw materials and packaging materials are subject to price volatility caused by external factors, such as
commodity price fluctuations, changes in supply and demand, logistics and processing costs, our bargaining power with suppliers,
inflation, and governmental regulations and policies. Our production volume, quality of products and profit margins may be adversely
affected. There is no assurance that raw material costs will not increase significantly in the future. As is customary in our
industry, we typically are not able to immediately pass raw material price increases onto our customers. As a result, any
significant price increase of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. Also, if we
were to increase price, we may not be able to completely pass on the increase in raw materials to consumers. Also, such an increase
in price may adversely affect our demand. If all or a significant number of our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our
requirements, we could suffer shortages or significant cost increases. Our suppliers could fail to meet our needs for various
reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, epidemic, crop failure, strikes, transportation
interruptions, or government regulation. A failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers&rsquo; financial difficulties,
including insolvency. Changing suppliers may require long lead time. We may not be able to locate alternative suppliers in
sufficient quantities, of suitable quality, or at an acceptable price. Continued supply disruptions could exert pressure on our
costs, and we cannot assure you that all or part of any increased costs can be passed along to our customers in a timely manner or
at all, which could negatively affect our business, overall profitability and financial performance.</P>

of diverse, alternative, pre-qualified suppliers of raw materials needed to produce one or more of our products. This approach allows
us to secure more favorable commercial terms with our existing suppliers and also reduces the risk of business disruption at one or more
stages of the E2E supply chain.</P>

Measures.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">PRC advertising laws, rules
and regulations require advertisers, advertising operators and advertising distributors to ensure that the content of the advertisements
they prepare or distribute is fair and accurate and is in full compliance with applicable law. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2022,
2023 and 2024, 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.1% of our revenues were derived from advertising service. We did not derive any revenue from advertising
service for the six&nbsp;months ended June&nbsp;30, 2025. Violation of these laws, rules or regulations may result in penalties, including
fines, confiscation of advertising fees and orders to cease dissemination of the advertisements. In circumstances involving three or more
illegal acts within two&nbsp;years or other serious violations, a fine of not less than five times but not more than ten times the advertising
expense or a fine of not less than RMB1,000,000 but not more than RMB2,000,000 shall be imposed, and the PRC government may revoke a violator&rsquo;s
business license and revoke the advertisement examination and approval documents and refuse to accept its application for advertisement
examination within one year. Complying with these requirements and any penalties or fines for any failure to comply may significantly
reduce the attractiveness of our platform and increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">In addition, for advertising
content related to specific types of products and services, advertisers, advertising agencies and advertising distributors must confirm
that the advertisers have obtained requisite government approvals, including the advertiser&rsquo;s operating qualifications, proof of
quality inspection of the advertised products, and, with respect to certain industries, government approval of the content of the advertisement
and filing with the local authorities. Pursuant to the Internet Advertising
Administrative Measures, we are required to take steps to monitor the content of advertisements displayed by us. This requires considerable
resources and time, and could significantly affect the operation of our business, while at the same time also exposing us to increased
liability under the relevant laws, rules and regulations. The costs associated with complying with these laws, rules and regulations,
including any penalties or fines for our failure to so comply if required, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Any further change in the classification of our online advertising and other related services by
the PRC government may also significantly disrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our business and prospects.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We regard our
trademarks, copyrights, domain names, know-how, patents, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely
on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements, including confidentiality and non-compete agreements
with our employees and others, to protect our proprietary rights. As of June&nbsp;30, 2025, we had registered 279 trademarks, 1
copyright of works and 5 computer software copyrights in China, including three registered trademarks in Hong&nbsp;Kong. We may fail
to own or apply for key trademarks in a timely fashion, or at all. For example, several logos we have used for&nbsp;years cannot be
registered as trademarks in certain trademark categories in China because a company unaffiliated to us has pre-emptively registered
similar logos as trademarks in such categories. As a result, we have been and will not be able to use such logos in areas covered by
such trademark categories. Such company complained to the Market Supervision Bureau for the trademark infringement of DDC Shanghai,
and DDC Shanghai has already applied for the invalidations of these trademarks at the State Intellectual Property Office, or the
SIPO, as well as indicted a series of related administrative actions which have been already accepted by the court. As the
trademarks under the legal proceeding are not relevant to our main business and we have adopted timely steps to make enough
adjustments to relevant business, including stopped using them in any public place, the unavailability of these trademarks would not
materially and adversely affect our business. If such third party actually use such trademarks in product or service similar to us
in the future, consumers may be confused and associate any quality issue on the products and services such third party provides with
us, which will have an adverse impact on our brand image. We may become an attractive target for certain copycat websites that
attempt to cause confusion or diversion of traffic from us in the future because of our brand recognition as a food-related
content-driven lifestyle brand in China. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged,
invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive
advantages. In addition, there can be no assurance that (i)&nbsp;our application for registration of trademarks, patents, and other
intellectual property rights will be approved, (ii)&nbsp;any intellectual property rights will be adequately protected, or
(iii)&nbsp;such intellectual property rights will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid
or unenforceable. Further, because of the rapid pace of technological changes in our industry, parts of our business rely on
technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and
technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">It is often difficult
to register, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights in China. Statutory laws and regulations are subject to judicial
interpretation and enforcement and may not be applied consistently due to the lack of clear guidance on statutory interpretation.
Confidentiality, invention assignment and non-compete agreements may be breached by counterparties, and there may not be adequate
remedies available to us for any such breach. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property
rights or to enforce our contractual rights in China. Policing any unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and
costly and the steps we take may be inadequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. In the
event  that we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, such litigation could result
in substantial costs and a diversion of our management and financial resources, and could put our intellectual property at risk of
being invalidated or narrowed in scope. We can provide no assurance that we will prevail in such litigation, and even if we do
prevail, we may not obtain a meaningful recovery. In addition, our trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to, or
be independently discovered by, our competitors. Any failure in maintaining, protecting or enforcing our intellectual property
rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.</P>

business. For example, we may be required to negotiate with, or institute litigation when negotiation fails, against our suppliers for
the losses arising out of contaminated raw materials. The compensation clauses in the supply contract may not be adequate enough to remedy
our damages. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could negatively affect our sales, profitability
and prospects. Even if any such litigation is resolved in our favor, we may not be able to successfully enforce the judgment and remedies
awarded by the court and such remedies may not be adequate to compensate us for our actual or anticipated related losses, whether tangible
or intangible. Negative publicity relating to such litigation, arbitrations, legal disputes, claims or administrative proceedings may
damage our reputation and adversely affect the image of our brands and services. In addition, ongoing litigation, arbitrations, legal
disputes, claims or administrative proceedings may distract our management&rsquo;s attention and consume our time and other resources.
Furthermore, any litigations, arbitrations, legal disputes, claims or administrative proceedings which are not of material importance
may escalate due to the various factors involved, such as the facts and circumstances of the cases, the likelihood of winning or losing,
the monetary amount at stake, and the parties concerned continue to evolve in the future, and such factors may result in these cases becoming
of material importance to us. We are subject to several legal proceedings, which, in the opinion of our management, would not have a material
and/or adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may continue to subject to legal proceedings in
the future. We cannot assure you that the outcome of the legal proceedings in the future, if any, will be favorable to us. If any verdict
or award is rendered against us or if we decide to settle the disputes, we may be required to incur monetary damages or other liabilities.
Even if we can successfully defend ourselves, we may have to incur substantial costs and spend substantial time and efforts in these lawsuits.
Consequently, any future litigation, legal disputes, claims or administrative proceedings could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.</P>

We base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends and strategic objectives. Many of our expenses, such as interest expense
on our debt, dividend obligations on our preferred stock, tax liabilities, office leases and certain personnel costs, are relatively fixed.
We may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in our cash flow. Accordingly, we may be required
to take actions to pay expenses, such as selling bitcoin or using proceeds from equity or debt financings, some of which could cause significant
variation in operating results in any quarter.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">As of December&nbsp;31, 2024,
our outstanding indebtedness was $21,120,674, and our annual interest expense was $2,293,230. As of June&nbsp;30, 2025, our outstanding
indebtedness was $20,373,269, and our annual interest expense was $163,797. As part of our bitcoin strategy, we expect to incur or continue
to incur additional indebtedness and other fixed charges. If our food innovations business does not generate cash flow in future periods
sufficient to satisfy our financial obligations, including our debt and cash dividend obligations, we intend to fund our obligations using
cash flow generated by equity or debt financings. Our ability to obtain equity or debt financing may in turn depend on, among other factors,
the value of our bitcoin holdings, investor sentiment and the general public perception of bitcoin, our strategy and our value proposition.
Accordingly, a significant decline in the market value of our bitcoin holdings or a negative shift in these other factors may create liquidity
and credit risks, as such a decline or such shifts may adversely impact our ability to secure sufficient equity or debt financing to satisfy
our financial obligations, including our debt and cash dividend obligations. These risks could materialize at times when bitcoin is trading
below its carrying value on our most recent balance sheet or our cost basis. As bitcoin constitutes the vast bulk of assets on our balance
sheet, if we are unable to secure equity or debt financing in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all, we may be required to sell
bitcoin to satisfy these obligations. Any such sale of bitcoin may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial
condition, and could impair our ability to secure additional equity or debt financing in the future. Our inability to secure additional
equity or debt financing in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all, or to sell our bitcoin in amounts and at prices sufficient
to satisfy our financial obligations, including our debt service and cash dividend obligations, could cause us to default under such obligations.
Any default on our current or future indebtedness or preferred stock may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See
&ldquo;Risks Related to Our Outstanding and Potential Future Indebtedness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Risks Related to Our Series&nbsp;A Perpetual
Strike Preferred Stock&rdquo; for additional details about the risks which may impact us if we are unable to satisfy our debt service

our strategy to acquire and hold bitcoin. This strategy has not been tested over an extended period of time or under different market

in the long term, the short-term price of bitcoin declined in recent periods during which the inflation rate increased. If bitcoin prices
were to decrease or our bitcoin strategy otherwise proves unsuccessful, our financial condition, results of operations, and the market

custodians and negotiating contractual arrangements intended to establish that our property interest in custodially-held bitcoin is not
subject to claims of our custodians&rsquo; creditors, applicable insolvency law is not fully developed with respect to the holding of
digital assets in custodial accounts. If our custodially-held bitcoin were nevertheless considered to be the property of our custodians&rsquo;
estates in the event that any such custodians were to enter bankruptcy, receivership or similar insolvency proceedings, we could be treated
as a general unsecured creditor of such custodians, inhibiting our ability to exercise ownership rights with respect to such bitcoin,
or delaying or hindering our access to our bitcoin holdings, and this may ultimately result in the loss of the value related to some or
all of such bitcoin, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition as well as the market price of our listed securities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The broader digital
assets industry is subject to counterparty risks, which could adversely impact the adoption rate, price, and use of bitcoin. A
series of recent high-profile bankruptcies, closures, liquidations, regulatory enforcement actions and other events relating to
companies operating in the digital asset industry have highlighted the counterparty risks applicable to owning and transacting in
digital assets. Although these bankruptcies, closures, liquidations and other events have not resulted in any loss or
misappropriation of our bitcoin, nor have such events adversely impacted our access to our bitcoin, they have, in the short-term,
likely negatively impacted the adoption rate and use of bitcoin. Additional bankruptcies, closures, liquidations, regulatory
enforcement actions or other events involving participants in the digital assets industry in the future may further negatively
impact the adoption rate, price, and use of bitcoin, limit the availability to us of financing collateralized by bitcoin, or create
or expose additional counterparty risks. Changes in the accounting treatment of our bitcoin holdings could have significant
accounting impacts, including increasing the volatility of our results. We have adopted ASU&nbsp;2023-08 as of January&nbsp;1, 2025,
which requires us to measure our bitcoin holdings at fair value in our statement of financial position, and to recognize gains and
losses from changes in the fair value of our bitcoin in net income each reporting period beginning January&nbsp;1, 2025.
ASU&nbsp;2023-08 also requires us to provide certain interim and annual disclosures with respect to our bitcoin holdings. The
standard is now effective, and we have applied a cumulative-effect net increase to the opening balance of retained earnings as of
January&nbsp;1, 2025 of $12.745&nbsp;billion. Due in particular to the volatility in the price of bitcoin, we expect the adoption of
ASU&nbsp;2023-08 to have a material impact on our financial results in future periods, increase the volatility of our financial results, and affect
the carrying value of our bitcoin on our balance sheet. As described in greater detail under the risk factor heading &ldquo;Risks Related
to Our Business in General&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;Unrealized fair value gains on our bitcoin holdings could cause us to become subject to the
corporate alternative minimum tax under the Inflation Reduction Act&nbsp;of&nbsp;2022,&rdquo; ASU&nbsp;2023-08 could also have adverse
tax consequences. These impacts could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial results and the market price of our listed
securities. Additionally, as a result of ASU&nbsp;2023-08 requiring a cumulative-effect adjustment to our opening balance of retained
earnings as of January&nbsp;1, 2025 and not permitting retrospective restatement of our historical financial statements, our future results
will not be comparable to results from periods prior to our adoption of the guidance. The broader digital assets industry, including the
technology associated with digital assets, the rate of adoption and development of, and use cases for, digital assets, market perception
of digital assets, and the legal, regulatory, and accounting treatment of digital assets are constantly developing and changing, and there
may be additional risks in the future that are not possible to predict.</P>

industry in general, and the use and acceptance of bitcoin in particular, may also impact the price of bitcoin and is subject to a high
degree of uncertainty. The pace of worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoin may depend, for instance, on public familiarity
with digital assets, ease of buying, accessing or gaining exposure to bitcoin, institutional demand for bitcoin as an investment asset,
the participation of traditional financial institutions in the digital assets industry, consumer demand for bitcoin as a store of value
or means of payment, and the availability and popularity of alternatives to bitcoin. Even if growth in bitcoin adoption occurs in the

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Because bitcoin has no physical
existence beyond the record of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, a variety of technical factors related to the Bitcoin blockchain
could also impact the price of bitcoin. For example, malicious attacks by miners, inadequate mining fees to incentivize validating of
bitcoin transactions, hard &ldquo;forks&rdquo; of the Bitcoin blockchain into multiple blockchains, and advances in digital computing,
algebraic geometry, and quantum computing could undercut the integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain and negatively affect the price of bitcoin.
The liquidity of bitcoin may also be reduced and damage to the public perception of bitcoin may occur, if financial institutions were
to deny or limit banking services to businesses that hold bitcoin, provide bitcoin-related services or accept bitcoin as payment, which
could also decrease the price of bitcoin. Actions by U.S.&nbsp;banking regulators, such as the issuance in February&nbsp;2023 by Federal
banking agencies of the &ldquo;Interagency Liquidity Risk Statement,&rdquo; which cautioned banks on contagion risks posed by providing
services to digital assets customers, and similar actions, have in the past resulted in or contributed to reductions in access to banking
services for bitcoin-related customers and service providers, or the willingness of traditional financial institution to participate in
markets for digital assets. The liquidity of bitcoin may also be impacted to the extent that changes in applicable laws and regulatory
requirements negatively impact the ability of exchanges and trading venues to provide services for bitcoin and other digital assets.</P>

of our bitcoin based on quoted (unadjusted) prices on the Coinbase exchange (our principal market for bitcoin). Prior to our adoption
of ASU&nbsp;2023-08 on January&nbsp;1, 2025, we performed an analysis each quarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances,
principally decreases in the quoted (unadjusted) prices on the active exchange, indicated that it was more likely than not that any of
our bitcoin assets were impaired. In determining if an impairment had occurred, we considered the lowest price of one bitcoin quoted on
the active exchange at any time since acquiring the specific
bitcoin held. If the carrying value of a bitcoin exceeded that lowest price at any time during the quarter, an impairment loss was deemed
to have occurred with respect to that bitcoin in the amount equal to the difference between its carrying value and such lowest price,
and subsequent increases in the price of bitcoin did not affect the carrying value of our bitcoin. Gains (if any) were not recorded until
realized upon sale, at which point they would be presented net of any impairment losses. In determining the gain to be recognized upon
sale, we calculated the difference between the sale price and carrying value of the specific bitcoin sold immediately prior to sale.</P>

the fair value of our bitcoin in net income each reporting period. ASU&nbsp;2023-08 also requires us to provide certain interim and annual
disclosures with respect to our bitcoin holdings. We have applied a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings
as of January&nbsp;1, 2025 of $12.745&nbsp;billion. ASU&nbsp;2023-08 does not permit retrospective restatement of prior periods. Accordingly,
we expect the adoption of ASU&nbsp;2023-08 to significantly affect the carrying value of our bitcoin on our balance sheet.</P>

of ASU&nbsp;2023-08, we may incur greater losses during periods when we previously would have incurred smaller losses or no losses because
we had already impaired the carrying value of our bitcoin to a low price observed during a prior period, and we may also incur gains during
periods when the market value of bitcoin rises, as compared to periods prior to January&nbsp;1, 2025, when we would not have incurred
any gains under similar circumstances. Accordingly, due in particular to the volatility in the price of bitcoin, we expect the adoption
of ASU&nbsp;2023-08 to increase the volatility of our financial results. Additionally, as a result of ASU&nbsp;2023-08 requiring a cumulative-effect
adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings as of January&nbsp;1, 2025 and not permitting retrospective restatement of prior
periods, our future results will not be comparable to results from periods prior to our adoption of the guidance.</P>

digital assets have experienced a surge of investor attention since bitcoin was invented in 2008, until recently investors in the United&nbsp;States
had limited means to gain direct exposure to bitcoin through traditional investment channels, and instead generally were only able to
hold bitcoin through &ldquo;hosted&rdquo; wallets provided by digital asset service providers or through &ldquo;unhosted&rdquo; wallets
that expose the investor to risks associated with loss or hacking of their private keys. Given the relative novelty of digital assets,
general lack of familiarity with the processes needed to hold bitcoin directly, as well as the potential reluctance of financial planners
and advisers to recommend direct bitcoin holdings to their retail customers because of the manner in which such holdings are custodied,
some investors have sought exposure to bitcoin through investment vehicles that hold bitcoin and issue shares representing fractional
undivided interests in their underlying bitcoin holdings. These vehicles, which were previously offered only to &ldquo;accredited investors&rdquo;
on a private placement basis, have in the past traded at substantial premiums to net asset value, possibly due to the relative scarcity
of traditional investment vehicles providing investment exposure to bitcoin.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">On January&nbsp;10,
2024, the SEC approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETPs, the shares of which can be sold in public offerings and are
traded on U.S.&nbsp;national securities exchanges. The approved ETPs commenced trading directly to the public on January&nbsp;11,
2024, with a trading volume of $4.6&nbsp;billion on the first&nbsp;trading day. On January&nbsp;11, 2024, and in the
subsequent&nbsp;days following the SEC&rsquo;s approval of the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETPs. To the extent investors
view our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares as providing exposure to bitcoin, it is possible that the value of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares may also have included a premium over the value of our bitcoin due to the prior scarcity of traditional investment vehicles
providing investment exposure to bitcoin, and that the value declined due to investors now having a greater range of options to gain
exposure to bitcoin and investors choosing to gain such exposure through ETPs rather than our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares.
Additionally, on May&nbsp;23, 2024, the SEC approved rule changes permitting the listing and trading of spot ETPs that invest in
ether, the main crypto asset supporting the Ethereum blockchain. The approved spot ETPs commenced trading directly to the public on
July&nbsp;23, 2024. The listing and trading of spot ETPs for ether offers investors another alternative to gain exposure to digital
assets, which could result in a decline in the trading price of bitcoin as well as a decline in the value of our Class&nbsp;A
ordinary shares relative to the value of our bitcoin, as well as our series A perpetual strike preferred stock.</P>

company, and we believe we offer a different value proposition than a bitcoin investment vehicle such as a spot bitcoin ETP, investors
may nevertheless view our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares as an alternative to an investment in an ETP, and choose to purchase shares of
a spot bitcoin ETP instead of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. They may do so for a variety of reasons, including if they believe that
ETPs offer a &ldquo;pure play&rdquo; exposure to bitcoin that is generally not subject to federal income tax at the entity level as we
are, or the other risk factors applicable to an operating business, such as ours. Additionally, unlike spot bitcoin ETPs, we (i)&nbsp;do
not seek for our shares of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to track the value of the underlying bitcoin we hold before payment of expenses
and liabilities, (ii)&nbsp;do not benefit from various exemptions and relief under the Securities Exchange&nbsp;Act of 1934, as amended,
including Regulation&nbsp;M, and other securities laws, which enable ETPs to continuously align the value of their shares to the price
of the underlying assets they hold through share creation and redemption, (iii)&nbsp;are a Cayman company rather than a statutory trust,
and do not operate pursuant to a trust agreement that would require us to pursue one or more stated investment objectives, and (iv)&nbsp;are
not required to provide daily transparency as to our bitcoin holdings or our daily net asset value. Furthermore, recommendations by broker-dealers
to buy, hold, or sell complex products and non-traditional ETPs, or an investment
strategy involving such products, may be subject to additional or heightened scrutiny that would not be applicable to broker-dealers making
recommendations with respect to our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. Based on how we are viewed in the market relative to ETPs, and other
vehicles which offer economic exposure to bitcoin, such as bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds (&ldquo;ETFs&rdquo;), leveraged bitcoin
futures ETFs, and similar vehicles offered on international exchanges, any premium or discount in our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares relative

bitcoin ETPs have received approval from the SEC to list their shares on a U.S.&nbsp;national securities exchange with continuous share

collapse did not directly impact our business, financial condition or corporate assets, the FTX collapse may have increased regulatory
focus on the digital assets industry. Increased enforcement activity and changes in the regulatory environment, including changing interpretations
and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government or any new legislation affecting bitcoin, as well as
enforcement actions involving or impacting our trading venues, counterparties and custodians, may impose significant costs or significantly
limit our ability to hold and transact in bitcoin.</P>

that are wary of bitcoin or the regulatory concerns associated with bitcoin have in the past taken and may in the future take further
actions that may have an adverse effect on our business or the market price of our listed securities. For example, an affiliate of HSBC

relatively new and, in many cases, unregulated. Furthermore, there are many bitcoin trading venues which do not provide the public with
significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices and regulatory compliance. As a result,
the marketplace may lose confidence in bitcoin trading venues, including prominent exchanges that handle a significant volume of bitcoin

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">In 2019 there were
reports claiming that&nbsp;80-95% of bitcoin trading volume on trading venues was false or non-economic in nature, with specific
focus on unregulated exchanges located outside of the United&nbsp;States. The SEC also alleged as part of its June&nbsp;5, 2023
complaint against Binance Holdings Ltd. that Binance committed strategic and targeted &ldquo;wash trading&rdquo; through its
affiliates to artificially inflate the volume of certain digital assets traded on its exchange. The SEC has also brought recent
actions against individuals and digital asset market participants alleging that such persons artificially increased trading volumes
in certain digital assets through wash trades, or repeated buying and selling of the same assets in fictitious transactions to
manipulate their underlying trading price. Such reports and allegations may indicate that the bitcoin market is significantly
smaller than expected and that the United&nbsp;States makes up a significantly larger percentage of the bitcoin market than is
commonly understood. Any actual or perceived wash trading in the bitcoin market, and any other fraudulent or manipulative acts and
practices, could adversely affect the value of our bitcoin. Negative perception, a lack of stability in the broader bitcoin markets
and the closure, temporary shutdown or operational disruption of bitcoin trading venues, lending institutions, institutional
investors, institutional miners, custodians, or other major participants in the bitcoin ecosystem, due to fraud, business failure,
cybersecurity events, government-mandated regulation, bankruptcy, or for any other reason, may result in a decline in confidence in
bitcoin and the broader bitcoin ecosystem and greater volatility in the price of bitcoin. For example, in 2022, each of Celsius
Network, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and BlockFi filed for bankruptcy, following which the market prices of bitcoin
and other digital assets significantly declined. In addition, in June&nbsp;2023, the SEC announced enforcement actions against
Coinbase, Inc., and Binance Holdings Ltd., two providers of large trading venues for digital assets, which similarly was followed by
a decrease in the market price of bitcoin and other digital assets. These were followed in November&nbsp;2023, by an SEC enforcement
action against Payward Inc. and Payward Ventures Inc., together known as Kraken, another large trading venue for digital assets. As
the price of our listed securities is affected by the value of our bitcoin holdings, the failure of a major participant in the
bitcoin ecosystem could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our listed securities.</P>

that we could achieve if we were to purchase a more diversified portfolio of treasury assets, and the absence of diversification enhances
the risks inherent in our bitcoin strategy. The price of bitcoin experienced a significant decline in 2022, and this had, and any future

market capitalization. However, there are numerous alternative digital assets and many entities, including consortiums and financial institutions,
are researching and investing resources into private or permissioned blockchain platforms or digital assets that do not use proof-of-work
mining like the Bitcoin network. For example, in late 2022, the Ethereum network transitioned to a &ldquo;proof-of-stake&rdquo; mechanism
for validating transactions that requires significantly less computing power than proof-of-work mining. The Ethereum network has completed
another major upgrade since then and may undertake additional upgrades in the future. If the mechanisms for validating transactions in
Ethereum and other alternative digital assets are perceived as superior to proof-of-work mining, those digital assets could gain market
share relative to bitcoin.</P>

manipulation, compliance and internal control failures at exchanges, and various other risks inherent in its entirely electronic,
virtual form and decentralized network. During times of market instability, we may not be able to sell our bitcoin at favorable
prices or at all. For example, a number of bitcoin trading venues temporarily halted deposits and withdrawals in 2022, although the
Coinbase exchange (our principal market for bitcoin) has, to date, not done so. As a result, our bitcoin holdings may not be able to
serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents. Further, bitcoin we hold with our custodians
and transact with our trade execution partners does not enjoy the same protections as are available to cash or securities deposited
with or transacted by institutions subject to regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation. Additionally, we may be unable to enter into term loans or other capital raising transactions collateralized

capital raising transactions, including capital raising transactions using bitcoin as collateral, or otherwise generate funds using
our bitcoin holdings, or if we are forced to sell our bitcoin at a significant loss, in order to meet our working capital
requirements, our business and financial condition could be negatively impacted.</P>

across a variety of industries, including industries related to bitcoin, are increasing in frequency, persistence, and
sophistication, and, in many cases, are being conducted by sophisticated, well-funded and organized groups and individuals,
including state actors. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to systems and information (including
personal data and digital assets), disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to
detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. These attacks may
occur on our systems or those of our third-party service providers or partners. We may experience breaches of our security measures
due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities. In particular,
unauthorized parties have attempted, and we expect that they will continue to attempt, to gain access to our systems and facilities,
as well as those of our partners and third-party service providers, through various means, such as hacking, social engineering,
phishing and fraud. In the past, hackers have successfully employed a social engineering attack against one of our service providers
and misappropriated our digital assets, although, to date, such events have not been material to our financial condition or
operating results. Threats can come from a variety of sources, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions,
industrial espionage, and insiders. In addition, certain types of attacks could harm us even if our systems are left undisturbed.
For example, certain threats are designed to remain dormant or undetectable, sometimes for extended periods of time, or until
launched against a target and we may not be able to implement adequate preventative measures. Further, there has been an increase in
such activities due to the increase in work-from-home arrangements since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk of
cyberattacks could also be increased by cyberwarfare in connection with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, or
other future conflicts, including potential proliferation of malware into systems unrelated to such conflicts. Any future breach of
our operations or those of others in the bitcoin industry, including third-party services on which we rely, could materially and
adversely affect our business.</P>

in the custody of our bitcoin as the extent of potential risk of loss is dependent, in part, on the degree of diversification. If there
is a decrease in the availability of digital asset custodians that we believe can safely custody our bitcoin, for example, due to regulatory
developments or enforcement actions that cause custodians to discontinue or limit their services in the United&nbsp;States, we may need

private keys must be safeguarded and kept private in order to prevent a third party from accessing the bitcoin held in such wallet. To
the extent the private key(s)&nbsp;for a digital wallet are lost, destroyed, or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key(s)&nbsp;is
accessible, neither we nor our custodians will be able to access the bitcoin held in the related digital wallet. Furthermore, we cannot

relating to companies operating in the digital asset industry, including the filings for bankruptcy protection by Three Arrows
Capital, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, FTX Trading and Genesis Global Capital, the closure or liquidation of certain financial

subsequent settlement of a civil fraud lawsuit by the New&nbsp;York Attorney General against Genesis Global Capital, its parent

risk applicable to digital asset ownership and trading. Although these bankruptcies, closures and liquidations have not resulted in
any loss or misappropriation of our bitcoin, nor have such events adversely impacted our access to our bitcoin, legal precedent
created in these bankruptcy and other proceedings may increase the risk of future rulings adverse to our interests in the event one

strategies to create income streams or otherwise generate funds using our bitcoin holdings, we would become subject to additional counterparty
risks. Any significant non-performance by counterparties, including in particular the custodians with which we custody substantially
all of our bitcoin, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.</P>

ensures that the current political situation will remain in effect for 50&nbsp;years. Hong&nbsp;Kong has enjoyed the freedom to function
in a high degree of autonomy for its affairs, including currencies, immigration and custom, independent judiciary system and parliamentary
system. On July&nbsp;14, 2020, the United&nbsp;States signed an executive order to end the special status enjoyed by Hong&nbsp;Kong post-1997.
As the autonomy currently enjoyed were compromised, it could potentially impact Hong&nbsp;Kong&rsquo;s common law legal system and may
in turn bring about uncertainty in, for example, the enforcement of our contractual rights. This could, in turn, materially and adversely
affect our business and operation. Additionally, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in Hong&nbsp;Kong may not

began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws, rules and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of
legislation over the past four decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in
China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws, rules and regulations may not sufficiently
cover all aspects of economic activities in China or may be subject to significant degrees of interpretation by PRC regulatory agencies.
In particular, because these laws, rules and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited number of published decisions
and the nonbinding nature of such decisions, and because the laws, rules and regulations often give the relevant regulator significant
discretion in how to enforce them, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations involve uncertainties and
can be inconsistent and unpredictable. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules,
some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and which may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware
of our violation of these policies and rules until after the occurrence of the violation.</P>

administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it
may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than
in more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into and could materially

2023, the CSRC issued the Trial Measures which became effective on March&nbsp;31, 2023. On the same date, the CSRC circulated the
Guidance Rules and Notice on the CSRC&rsquo;s official website which became effective on March&nbsp;31, 2023. Under the Trial
Measures, either direct or indirect overseas offering and listing by domestic companies shall fulfill the filing procedure with the
CSRC with submitting relevant materials. Any overseas offering and listing made by an issuer that meets both the following
conditions will be determined as indirect: (1)&nbsp;50% or more of the issuer&rsquo;s operating revenue, total profit, total assets
or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year is accounted for by
domestic companies; and (2)&nbsp;the main parts of the issuer&rsquo;s business activities are conducted in the Chinese Mainland, or
its main places of business are located in the Chinese Mainland, or the senior managers in charge of its business operation and
management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in the Chinese Mainland. The determination as to whether or not an overseas
offering and listing by domestic companies is indirect, shall be made on a substance over form basis. When certain circumstances
happen, overseas offering and listing shall not be made. And If the intended overseas offering and listing necessitates a national
security review, relevant security review procedures shall be completed according to law before the application for such offering
and listing is submitted to any overseas parties such as securities regulatory agencies and trading venues. Pursuant to the Trial
Measures, the Guidance Rules and Notice, initial public offerings or listings in overseas markets shall be filed with the CSRC
within 3 working&nbsp;days after the relevant application is submitted overseas, while domestic enterprises that have submitted
valid applications for overseas offerings and listings but have not obtained the approval from the relevant overseas regulatory
authority or overseas stock exchange shall complete filings with the CSRC prior to their overseas offerings and listings. Our
initial public offer offering and listing was identified as an indirect overseas issuance and listing by the CSRC, in view of the
fact that the Trial Measures have come into effect on 31 March&nbsp;2023. We submitted the filing materials with the CSRC to fulfill
the filing procedure with the CSRC as per requirement of the Trial Measures and completed such proceeding in November&nbsp;2023.
However, there is no guarantee that we will continue to comply with the Trial Measures. If we fail to comply with the Trial
Measures, we will be required to correct our behaviors, facing warnings and fines which amount will range from RMB1,000,000 to
RMB10,000,000, and directly responsible personnel will also be warned and fined which amount will range from RMB500,000 to
RMB5,000,000. Any new policies, regulations, rules, actions or laws by the PRC government may subject us to material changes in
operations, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors
and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.</P>

the CSRC, together with the MOF, National Administration of State Secrets Protection and National Archives Administration of China, revised

of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies&rdquo;, and came into effect on March&nbsp;31, 2023, together with the
Trial Measures. One of the major revisions to the revised Provisions is expanding their application to cover indirect overseas offering
and listing, as is consistent with the Trial Measures. The revised Provisions require that, among other things, (a)&nbsp;a domestic company
that plans to, either directly or indirectly through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant individuals
or entities including securities companies, securities service providers and overseas regulators, any documents and materials that contain
state secrets or working secrets of government agencies, shall first obtain approval from competent authorities according to law, and
file with the secrecy administrative department at the same level; and (b)&nbsp;a domestic company that plans to, either directly or indirectly
through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant individuals and entities including securities companies,
securities service providers and overseas regulators, any other documents and materials that, if leaked, will be detrimental to national
security or public interest, shall strictly fulfill relevant procedures stipulated by applicable national regulations. Any failure or
perceived failure by our Company or our PRC subsidiaries to comply with the above confidentiality and archives administration requirements
under the revised Provisions and other PRC laws and regulations may result in the relevant entities being held legally liable by competent
authorities and referred to the judicial organ to be investigated for criminal liability if suspected of committing a crime.</P>

the local authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another

required registration or to update the previously filed registration, the subsidiary of such SPV in China may be prohibited from
distributing its profits or the proceeds from any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV may also

a non-resident enterprise conducts an &ldquo;indirect transfer&rdquo; by transferring the equity interests of a PRC &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo;
indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may
be subject to PRC corporate income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable
commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. SAT Circular
698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related
parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable
income of the transaction.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">In February&nbsp;2015, the
SAT issued SAT Circular 7, Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues Relating to Enterprise Income Tax on
Transfer of Assets between Non-resident Enterprises, which took effective on February&nbsp;3, 2015, to replace the rules relating to indirect
transfers in SAT Circular 698. SAT Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under SAT Circular
698. SAT Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under SAT Circular 698 but also transactions
involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, SAT
Circular&nbsp;7 provides clearer criteria than SAT Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe
harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. SAT Circular 7 also
brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable
assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an &ldquo;indirect transfer&rdquo; by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing
of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC
entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a &ldquo;substance
over form&rdquo; principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable
commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such
indirect transfer may be subject to PRC corporate income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer
is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.</P>

the Announcement on Issues Relating to Withholding at Source of Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises, which was issued by the SAT on
October&nbsp;17, 2017 and took effect on December&nbsp;1, 2017 and was most-recently amended on June&nbsp;15, 2018, the balance after
deducting the equity net value from the equity transfer income shall be the taxable income amount for equity transfer income. Equity transfer
income shall mean the consideration collected by the equity transfer or from the equity transfer, including various income in monetary
form and non-monetary form. Equity net value shall mean the tax computation basis for obtaining the said equity. The tax computation basis
for equity shall be: (i)&nbsp;the capital contribution costs actually paid by the equity transferor to a Chinese resident enterprise at
the time of investment and equity participation, or (ii)&nbsp;the equity transfer costs actually paid at the time of acquisition of such
equity to the original transferor of the said equity. Where there is reduction or appreciation of value during the equity holding period,
and the gains or losses may be confirmed pursuant to the rules of the finance and tax authorities of the State Council, the equity net
value shall be adjusted accordingly. When an enterprise computes equity transfer income, it shall not deduct the amount in the shareholders&rsquo;
retained earnings such as undistributed profits etc., of the investee enterprise, which may be distributed in accordance with the said
equity. In the event of partial transfer of equity under multiple investments or acquisitions, the enterprise shall determine the costs
corresponding to the transferred equity in accordance with the transfer ratio, out of all costs of the equity.</P>

obligated to pay the transfer price to the transferor shall act as withholding agents. According to SAT Circular 7, where the transferee
fails to withhold any or sufficient tax, the transferor shall declare and pay such tax to the tax authority by itself within the statutory
time limit. SAT Circular 37 further elaborates the relevant implemental rules regarding the calculation, reporting and payment obligations
of the withholding tax by the non-resident enterprises. In addition, the tax authority may also hold the withholding agents liable and
impose a penalty of ranging from 50% to 300% of the unpaid tax on them. The penalty imposed on the withholding agents may be reduced
or waived if the withholding agents have submitted the relevant materials in connection with the indirect transfer to the PRC tax authorities
in accordance with SAT Circular 7.</P>

rules concerning mergers and acquisitions including the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign
Investors (the &ldquo;M&amp;A Rules&rdquo;), established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and
acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. For example, the M&amp;A Rules require that the MOFCOM
be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise,
if (i)&nbsp;any important industry is concerned, (ii)&nbsp;such transaction involves factors that have or may have impact on the
national economic security, (iii)&nbsp;such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds famous
trademarks or PRC time-honored brands, or (iv)&nbsp;such PRC domestic enterprise is an affiliate of the foreign investor as
stipulated under the M&amp;A Rules. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law requires that the anti-trust governmental authority shall be
notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain thresholds are triggered. In addition, the security review rules
issued by the MOFCOM that became effective in September&nbsp;2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that
raise &ldquo;national defense and security&rdquo; concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire
de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise &ldquo;national security&rdquo; concerns are subject to strict review by the
MOFCOM, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review, including by structuring the transaction
through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses.
Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be
time consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOFCOM or its local counterparts may
delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions. It is unclear whether our business would be deemed to be in an industry
that raises &ldquo;national defense and security&rdquo; or &ldquo;national security&rdquo; concerns. However, the MOFCOM or other
government agencies may publish explanations in the future determining that our business is in an industry subject to the security
review, in which case our future acquisitions in the PRC, including those by way of entering into contractual control arrangements
with target entities, may be closely scrutinized or prohibited. Our ability to expand our business or maintain or expand our market
share through future acquisitions would as such be materially and adversely affected.</P>

Measures, either direct or indirect overseas offering and listing by domestic companies shall fulfill the filing procedure with the
CSRC with submitting relevant materials. Any overseas offering and listing made by an issuer that meets both the following
conditions will be determined as indirect: (1)&nbsp;50% or more of the issuer&rsquo;s operating revenue, total profit, total assets
or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year is accounted for by
domestic companies; and (2)&nbsp;the main parts of the issuer&rsquo;s business activities are conducted in the Chinese Mainland, or

happen, overseas offering and listing shall not be made. And If the intended overseas offering and listing necessitates a national
security review, relevant security review procedures shall be completed according to law before the application for such offering
and listing is submitted to any overseas parties such as securities regulatory agencies and trading venues. Pursuant to the Trial
Measures, the Guidance Rules and Notice, initial public offerings or listings in overseas markets shall be filed with the CSRC

valid applications for overseas offerings and listings but have not obtained the approval from the relevant overseas regulatory
authority or overseas stock exchange shall complete filings with the CSRC prior to their overseas offerings and listings. Our NYSE

promulgated the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and
Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142. SAFE Circular 142 regulated the
conversion by foreign-invested enterprises, or FIEs, of foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting the usage of converted
Renminbi. SAFE Circular 142 provided that any Renminbi capital converted from registered capitals in foreign currency of FIEs might
only be used for purposes within the business scopes approved by PRC governmental authority and such Renminbi capital might not be
used for equity investments within China unless otherwise permitted by PRC law. In addition, the SAFE strengthened its oversight of
the flow and use of Renminbi capital converted from registered capital in foreign currency of FIEs. The use of such Renminbi capital
might not be changed without SAFE approval, and such Renminbi capital might not in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the
proceeds of such loans had not been utilized. On July&nbsp;4, 2014, SAFE issued the Circular of the SAFE on Relevant Issues
Concerning the Pilot Reform in Certain Areas of the Administrative Method of the Conversion of Foreign Exchange Funds by
Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 36, which launched the pilot reform of administration regarding conversion of foreign
currency registered capitals of FIEs in 16 pilot areas. According to SAFE Circular 36, some of the restrictions under SAFE Circular
142 would not apply to the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of an ordinary FIE in the pilot areas, and such FIE was
permitted to use Renminbi converted from its foreign-currency registered capital to make equity investments in the PRC within and in
accordance with the authorized business scope of such FIEs, subject to certain registration and settlement procedure as set forth in
SAFE Circular 36. On March&nbsp;30, 2015, the SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming the Management Approach Regarding the
Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19. SAFE Circular 19 took effect as of
June&nbsp;1, 2015 and superseded SAFE Circular 36 and SAFE Circular 142 on the same date. SAFE Circular 19 launched a nationwide
reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of FIEs and allows FIEs to settle their foreign
exchange capital at their discretion, but continued to prohibit FIEs from using the Renminbi fund converted from their foreign
exchange capitals for (i)&nbsp;expenditure beyond their business scopes or prohibited by the laws and regulations of the state,
(ii)&nbsp;directly or indirectly investing in securities unless otherwise provided by laws and regulations, (iii)&nbsp;providing
entrusted loans in RMB (except where the business scope permits), repaying loans between non-financial enterprises (including
advances from third parties) or repaying RMB loans from bank that have been transferred to third parties, (iv)&nbsp;paying the
related expenses of purchasing real estate not for self-use except for foreign-invested real estate enterprises. Violations of these
Circulars could result in severe monetary or other penalties. These restrictions were reiterated and replaced by SAFE Circular 16,
the Circular on Policies for Reforming and Regulating the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement under the Capital Account, which
was promulgated and implemented by the SAFE on June&nbsp;9, 2016. According to SAFE Circular 16, the foreign exchange receipts under
the capital account of a domestic institution shall be used pursuant to the principle of authenticity and self-use within its
business scope. The foreign exchange receipts under the capital account of a domestic institution and the Renminbi funds obtained
from foreign exchange settlement may be used by the domestic institution for expenditures under the current account within its
business scope or the expenditure under the capital account permitted by laws and regulations. Such receipts and funds of the
domestic institutions shall not be used for the following purposes: (i)&nbsp;directly or indirectly used for payment beyond the
business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations; (ii)&nbsp;directly or indirectly used
for investment in securities or other investments than principal-secured products of banks unless otherwise provided by relevant
laws and regulations; (iii)&nbsp;directly or indirectly used for granting the granting of loans to non-affiliated enterprises, with
the exception that such granting is expressly permitted in the business license; and (iv)&nbsp;used for construction or purchase of
real estate for purpose other than self-use (exception applies for real estate enterprises). Where there is any contractual
agreement on the use scope of receipt under the capital account between a domestic institution and other parties involved, the
domestic institution shall not use such receipts and funds beyond the scope.</P>

of the securities laws of the United&nbsp;States or any state in the United&nbsp;States. A judgment of a United&nbsp;States court for
civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United&nbsp;States may not be enforceable in or recognized by the
courts of the jurisdictions where our directors and officers reside, and the judicial recognition process may be time-consuming. It may
be difficult for you to enforce judgments obtained in U.S.&nbsp;courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S.&nbsp;federal

have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the Cayman Islands and many other countries

common in the United&nbsp;States, including securities law class actions and fraud claims, generally are difficult to pursue as a matter
of law or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to obtaining information needed
for shareholder investigations or litigation outside China or otherwise with respect to foreign entities. Although the local authorities
in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement
cross-border supervision and administration, such regulatory cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States
has not been efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. According to Article&nbsp;177 of the PRC Securities
Law which became effective in March&nbsp;2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence
collection activities within the territory of the PRC.</P>

affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (Revised) and the common law
of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary
responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands.
The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as
from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands.
The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from statutes
or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United&nbsp;States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities
laws as compared to the United&nbsp;States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative
action in a Federal court of the United&nbsp;States.</P>

unlikely (i)&nbsp;to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United&nbsp;States predicated upon the civil
liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United&nbsp;States or any state; and (ii)&nbsp;in original actions
brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United&nbsp;States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions
are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained
in the United&nbsp;States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court
of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes
upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a
foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must
not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter,
impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, and or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural
justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public
policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.</P>

such registrations, however, as of the date of the Annual Report, the lease agreements relating to certain of our business premises had

U.S.&nbsp;SEC and PCAOB and the Chinese counterparts, namely, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, and PRC

cooperative framework between the parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations undertaken
by the PCAOB, the CSRC or the PRC Ministry of Finance in the United&nbsp;States and the PRC, respectively. Despite the MOU, on
December&nbsp;7, 2018, the SEC and the PCAOB issued a joint statement highlighting continued challenges faced by the U.S.&nbsp;regulators
in their oversight of financial statement audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant operations in China. On April&nbsp;21,

focus in the United&nbsp;States on access to audit and other information currently protected by laws in China, on December&nbsp;2, 2020,
U.S.&nbsp;Congress passed S. 945, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The HFCAA has been signed by the President into law.
Pursuant to the HFCAA, the SEC is required to propose rules to prohibit the securities of any registrant from being listed on any of the
U.S.&nbsp;securities exchanges or traded &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; if the PCAOB is unable to inspect the work of the accounting firm
for three consecutive&nbsp;years. On March&nbsp;24, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to Form&nbsp;20 and sought public comment in response
to the HFCAA.&nbsp;Consistent with the HFCAA, these amendments require the submission of documentation to the SEC establishing that a
&ldquo;commission-identified registrant&rdquo; (as defined in the amendments) is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that
foreign jurisdiction and also require disclosure in a foreign issuer&rsquo;s annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental
influence on, such registrant. We will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies us as having a &lsquo;non-inspection&rsquo;
year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC.</P>

which our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted. The enactment of the HFCAA and other efforts to increase U.S.&nbsp;regulatory
access to audit work papers could cause investor uncertainty for affected issuers, including us, and the market price of the share could
be adversely affected as uncertainty remains over whether there will be a compromise solution. In the worst case, our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary

SEC adopted final rules implementing the HFCAA.&nbsp;On a rolling basis, the SEC will identify issuers with auditors that the PCAOB is
unable to inspect or investigate completely because of non-US governmental restrictions. If an issuer is identified for three consecutive&nbsp;years,
the SEC will publish an order prohibiting the trading of the issuer&rsquo;s securities on a U.S.&nbsp;stock exchange and the U.S.&nbsp;over-the-counter
market. If the SEC identifies us for three consecutive&nbsp;years as an issuer with auditors that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate
completely because of non-US governmental restrictions, under the HFCAA, our securities may be prohibited from being traded on a national
securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United&nbsp;States. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination
Report on December&nbsp;16, 2021, which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting
firms headquartered in mainland China or Hong&nbsp;Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the PRC, because of a position taken by one
or more authorities in the PRC or Hong&nbsp;Kong. In addition, the PCAOB&rsquo;s report identified the specific registered public accounting

China or Hong&nbsp;Kong and was identified in this report as a firm subject to the PCAOB&rsquo;s determination.</P>

signed a Statement of Protocol with the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC governing inspections and investigations of audit
firms based in China and Hong&nbsp;Kong, and stated the cooperation will be launched soon. The Statement scheduled several important
issues including the purpose, scope and form of the cooperation, use of information and specific data protection during the cooperation,
etc. In particular, Chinese authorities have committed to four critical items: First, in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the
PCAOB has independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation; Second, the PCAOB gets direct access to
interview or take testimony from all personnel of the audit firms whose issuer engagements are being inspected or investigated; Third,
the PCAOB has the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC, in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and Fourth, PCAOB
inspectors can see complete audit work papers without any redactions. On the last item, the PCAOB was able to establish view only procedures&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;as
it has done in the past with certain other jurisdictions&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;for targeted pieces of information (for example, personally
identifiable information). As uncertainties remain regarding the details of the cooperation and the implementation by the authorities
of the two sides, the risks we faced regarding the de-listing of our securities because of non-compliance to the laws and regulations
adopted by the US authorities will still exist.</P>

the PCAOB Board determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms

PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland
China and Hong&nbsp;Kong is subject to uncertainties and depends on a number of factors out of our and our auditor&rsquo;s control. The
PCAOB continues to demand complete access in mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong moving forward and is making plans to resume regular inspections
in early 2023 and beyond, as well as to continue pursuing ongoing investigations and initiate new investigations as needed. The PCAOB
has also indicated that it will act immediately to consider the need to issue new determinations with the HFCAA if needed. If the PCAOB
is unable to inspect and investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in China and we fail to retain another registered
public accounting firm that the PCAOB is able to inspect and investigate completely in 2023 and beyond, or if we otherwise fail to meet

subject to the PCAOB inspection and investigation, including but not limited to inspection of the audit working papers related to our
operations, may depend on the relevant positions of U.S.&nbsp;and Chinese regulators. Our auditor&rsquo;s audit working papers related
to our operations are located in China. With respect to audits of companies with operations in China, there are uncertainties about the
ability of its auditor to fully cooperate with a request by the PCAOB for audit working papers in China without the approval of Chinese
authorities. If the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor because of a position taken by an authority in a
foreign jurisdiction, or the PCAOB re-evaluates its determination as a result of any obstruction with the implementation of the Statement
of Protocol, then such lack of inspection or re-evaluation could cause trading in the Company&rsquo;s securities to be prohibited under
the HFCAA, and ultimately result in a determination by a securities exchange to delist our securities. Accordingly, the HFCAA calls for
additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors,
especially the non-U.S.&nbsp;auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB.&nbsp;These developments could add uncertainties to our offering.</P>

is unable to conduct full inspections of auditors in China, it will become more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditors&rsquo;
audit procedures and quality control procedures as compared to auditors who primarily work in jurisdictions where the PCAOB has full inspection
access. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections. In addition, the SEC may initiate proceedings against
our independent registered public accounting firm, which could result in the imposition of penalties against such accounting firm, such
as suspension of its ability to practice before the SEC.&nbsp;If we are required to engage a new audit firm, we may incur significant
expense and management time. All of these could cause our investors and potential investors in our securities to lose confidence in our
audit procedures, reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements. The market price of our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary
Shares could be adversely affected. Further, if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or investigate completely independent registered
public accounting firm for a period of two consecutive&nbsp;years, trading in our securities may be prohibited under the HFCAA and an
exchange may determine to delist our securities. The delisting of our securities, or the threat of such securities being delisted, may
materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.</P>

August&nbsp;6, 2020, the President&rsquo;s Working Group on Financial Markets, or PWG, released a report recommending that the SEC
take steps to implement the five recommendations, including enhanced listing standards on U.S.&nbsp;stock exchanges with respect to
PCAOB inspection of accounting firms. This would require, as a condition to initial and continued listing on a U.S.&nbsp;stock
exchange, PCAOB access to work papers of the principal audit firm for the audit of the listed company. The report permits the new
listing standards to provide for a transition period until January&nbsp;1, 2022 for listed companies, but would apply immediately to
new listings once the necessary rulemakings and/or standard-setting are effective. It is unclear if and when the SEC will make rules
to implement the recommendations proposed in the PWG report, especially in light of its ongoing rulemaking pursuant to the
HFCAA.&nbsp;Any of these factors and developments could potentially lead to a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.</P>

the Exchange&nbsp;Act. In December&nbsp;2012, the SEC instituted administrative proceedings against the &ldquo;big four&rdquo;
PRC-based accounting firms, including our former independent registered public accounting firm, alleging that these firms had
violated U.S.&nbsp;securities laws and the SEC&rsquo;s rules and regulations thereunder by failing to provide to the SEC the
firms&rsquo; audit work papers with respect to certain PRC-based companies that are publicly traded in the United&nbsp;States. On
January&nbsp;22, 2014, the administrative law judge, or the ALJ, presiding over the matter rendered an initial decision that each of
the firms had violated the SEC&rsquo;s rules of practice by failing to produce audit papers and other documents to the SEC. On
February&nbsp;6, 2015, the four China-based accounting firms each agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the
dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC and audit U.S.-listed companies. The settlement required
the firms to follow detailed procedures and to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms&rsquo; audit documents via the
CSRC.&nbsp;Under the terms of the settlement, the underlying proceeding against the four China-based accounting firms was deemed
dismissed with prejudice four&nbsp;years after entry of the settlement. The four-year mark occurred on February&nbsp;6, 2019.</P>

Settlement Agreement may result in greater dilution to our shareholders than currently estimated. If the market price of our Class A Ordinary
Shares declines, we may be required to issue more True-up Shares than the estimated amount to satisfy the true-up obligation. For example,
if our share price declines to $1.00, we would need to issue approximately 125,894 True-up Shares to fulfill the $185,000 commitment,
compared to the estimated 100,000 True-up Shares being registered in this prospectus based on approximately 64% discount to the $3.19
closing price as of January 12, 2026. Such issuances would dilute the ownership percentage and earnings per share of our existing shareholders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Prior to our IPO in November&nbsp;2023,
there has been no public market for our Ordinary Shares, including our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares. An active trading market for our
Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares may not be sustained. The lack of an active trading market may impair the value of your shares and your ability
to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling
our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares and entering into strategic partnerships or acquiring other complementary products, technologies or businesses
by using our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares as consideration.</P>

satisfy exchange listing standards, we could be delisted, which would have a negative effect on the price of our securities. For example,
we are not currently compliant with NYSE American listing standards, including, for example, the requirement that we timely file reports
with the SEC and that our shares trade above $1.00 per share. If we fail to satisfy these and all other listing requirements our shares
will be delisted on the NYSE American.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We expect that the price of
our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares will fluctuate substantially. For example, since January&nbsp;1, 2025 through January&nbsp;15, 2026,
the closing price (as adjusted for reverse split) of our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares as quoted on the NYSE American has ranged from
$1.85 to $19.92 per share.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We have a dual-class share
structure such that our ordinary shares will consist of Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares and class B ordinary shares (&ldquo;Class&nbsp;B
Ordinary Shares&rdquo;). In respect of matters requiring the votes of shareholders, each Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Share is entitled to one
vote and each Class&nbsp;B Ordinary Share, which are held by our founder and CEO, Norma Chu, is entitled to ten votes. Under our Articles,
Class&nbsp;B Ordinary Shares are not convertible into Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares. Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares are not convertible into
Class&nbsp;B Ordinary Shares. Only Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares are tradable on the market.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The holder of
Class&nbsp;B Ordinary shares have the ability to control matters requiring shareholders&rsquo; approval, including any amendment of
our memorandum and articles of association. Any future issuances of Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares may be dilutive to the voting power
of holders of Class&nbsp;A Ordinary shares. Additionally, at our special stockholder meeting in November&nbsp;2024, our shareholders
authorized our Board of Directors to complete a reverse split of our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares within one year from shareholder
approval within a range of zero reverse split to a reverse split of 1 for 25, as determined by our Board. On April&nbsp;8, 2025, we
announced a one-for-25 reverse split of our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares and the Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares started trading
post-split on April&nbsp;21, 2025. However, we did not split the Class&nbsp;B Ordinary Shares. This measure increased the relative
voting power of the Class&nbsp;B Ordinary Shares and reduced the relative voting power of the Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares. As a
result of the dual-class share structure and the concentration of ownership, the holder of the Class&nbsp;B Ordinary shares has and
will continue to have considerable influence over matters such as decisions regarding mergers and consolidations, election of
directors and other significant corporate actions. The holder may take actions that are not in the best interest of us or our other
shareholders. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could have
the effect of depriving our other shareholders of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our
company and may reduce the price of our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence
corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transactions
that holders of Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares may view as beneficial.</P>

past and may continue in the future to trade below $5.00 per share. As a result, our stock could be known as a &ldquo;penny
stock&rdquo;, subject to certain exceptions, which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior
to the purchase of any penny stock. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; to be any
equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market
fluctuations, our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares could be considered to be a &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo;, subject to certain exceptions.
A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to
persons other than established members and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must
make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, a broker/dealer must receive the
purchaser&rsquo;s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase and must also provide certain
written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers
to sell our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares, and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary
Shares to resell them, if the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules apply. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you
understand the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks
generally do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock is often volatile and you may not be able to
buy or sell the stock when you want to.</P>

share option plan in 2023, or the 2023 ESOP, for the purpose of granting share-based compensation awards to our employees, directors
and consultants to incentivize their performance and align their interests with ours. As of the date hereof, awards may be granted
under the 2023 ESOP for up to 1,208,000 Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares. In addition, on January&nbsp;1 of each year, additional shares
will be added to the 2023 ESOP in an amount up to 10% of the Company&rsquo;s issued and outstanding Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares as
of December&nbsp;31 of the prior year; provided that the total number of Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares which may be issued upon
exercise of all options to be granted to all participants under the 2023 ESOP shall not in aggregate exceed 15% of the
Company&rsquo;s issued and outstanding Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant
share-based compensation expenses in the future. The amount of these expenses is based on the fair value of the share-based awards.
We account for compensation costs for all share options using a fair-value based method and recognize expenses in our consolidated
statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The expenses associated with share-based compensation will decrease our
profitability, perhaps materially, and the additional securities issued under share-based compensation plans
will dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders. However, if we limit the scope of our share-based compensation plan, we may
not be able to attract or retain key personnel who expect to be compensated by options.</P>

average) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income (the &ldquo;asset test&rdquo;). Based upon our current

to be treated as a PFIC, because the value of our assets for purposes of the asset test may be determined by reference to the market
price of our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares, fluctuations in the market price of our Shares may cause us to become a PFIC for the
current or subsequent taxable&nbsp;years. The determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC will also depend, in part, on the
composition and classification of our income, including the relative amounts of income generated by and the value of assets of our
strategic investment business as compared to our other businesses. Because there are uncertainties in the application of the
relevant rules, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, may challenge our classification of certain income and
assets as non- passive which may result in our being or becoming a PFIC in the current or subsequent&nbsp;years. In addition, the
composition of our income and assets will also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets and the cash raised in
our initial public offering. If we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of being a PFIC
may substantially increase. Because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules and PFIC status is a factual
determination made annually after the close of each taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for the
current taxable year or any future taxable year.</P>

Ordinary Shares and on the receipt of distributions on our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares to the extent such gain or distribution is treated
as an &ldquo;excess distribution&rdquo; under the United&nbsp;States federal income tax rules and such holder may be subject to burdensome
reporting requirements. Further, if we are a PFIC for any year during which a U.S.&nbsp;Holder holds our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares,
we will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding&nbsp;years during which such U.S.&nbsp;Holder holds our Class&nbsp;A

of the Exchange&nbsp;Act. The determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business&nbsp;day of an issuer&rsquo;s
most recently completed second fiscal quarter. We would lose our foreign private issuer status if, for example, more than 50% of our Ordinary
Shares are directly or indirectly held by residents of the United&nbsp;States and we fail to meet additional requirements necessary to
maintain our foreign private issuer status. If we lose our foreign private issuer status on this date, we will be required to file with
the SEC periodic reports and registration statements on U.S.&nbsp;domestic issuer forms, which are more detailed and extensive than the
forms available to a foreign private issuer. We will also have to mandatorily comply with U.S.&nbsp;federal proxy requirements, and our
officers, directors and principal shareholders will become subject to the short-swing profit disclosure and recovery provisions of Section&nbsp;16
of the Exchange&nbsp;Act. In addition, we will lose our ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements
under the NYSE rules. As a U.S.&nbsp;listed public company that is not a foreign private issuer, we will incur significant additional
legal, accounting and other expenses that we will not incur as a foreign private issuer, and accounting, reporting and other expenses
in order to maintain a listing on a U.S.&nbsp;securities exchange.</P>

as the rules of the NYSE.&nbsp;These rules and regulations are expected to significantly increase our accounting, legal and financial
compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. We also expect these rules and regulations to make it more expensive for
us to obtain and maintain directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract
and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. Accordingly, increases in costs incurred as

will have had relatively little experience with us or our industry, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results
and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if
any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or unfavorable research or issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, our
stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports covering us regularly, we
could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and result in the loss of
all or a part of your investment in us.</P>

with several other non-European Union jurisdictions, has recently introduced legislation aimed at addressing concerns raised by the Council
of the European Union as to offshore structures engaged in certain activities which attract profits without real economic activity. With
effect from January&nbsp;1, 2019, the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (Revised), or the Substance Law, and issued
Regulations and Guidance Notes came into force in the Cayman Islands introducing certain economic substance requirements for &ldquo;relevant
entities&rdquo; which are engaged in certain &ldquo;relevant activities,&rdquo; which in the case of exempted companies incorporated before
January&nbsp;1, 2019, will apply in respect of financial&nbsp;years commencing July&nbsp;1, 2019 and onwards. A&nbsp;&ldquo;relevant entity&rdquo;
includes an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, as is DDC Cayman; however, it is anticipated that our Company may remain
out of scope of the legislation or else be subject to more limited substance requirements. Although it is presently anticipated that the
Substance Law will have little material impact on us and our operations, as the legislation is new and remains subject to further clarification
and interpretation, it is not currently possible to ascertain the precise impact of these legislative changes on us and our operations.</P>

Agreement, the Company issued 59,106 Class A Ordinary Shares to the Selling Shareholder at $3.13 per share (representing $185,000 in aggregate

rely on both growing our own &ldquo;DayDayCook&rdquo; branded product sales and private label product sales. This combined strategy was
prompted by the need to (i)&nbsp;improve our competitiveness in the RTC, RTH, RTE and plant-based meat food sectors, (ii)&nbsp;expand
DayDayCook own-branded in the market by new acquisition with more scope of offline distributors and (iii)&nbsp;improve the overall margin
profile of the business. We expect growth for the DayDayCook own-branded product to outpace private-label product sales. This shift will
require us to plan, develop, and successfully execute on multi-channel sales, marketing, and distribution strategy.</P>

and Demand</I></B>&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;As the China RTC market is expected to benefit from a shift in customer taste and preferences to
convenient cooking and meal options, the RTC market is expected to grow to RMB564.5&nbsp;billion (US$83.5&nbsp;billion) by 2026, a CAGR
(2021-2026) of 17.2%. While plant-based products are a nascent Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (&ldquo;FMCG&rdquo;) category in China, there
is significant demand from younger customer segments for plant-based substitutes/alternatives. Demand for food products that are more
environmentally friendly and viable alternatives to/substitutes for traditional protein sources is expected to increase. As a result,
the market for plant-based products is expected to experience a CAGR (2021-2026) of 11.0%. Total revenue is projected to increase from
RMB5.1&nbsp;billion (US$703.3&nbsp;million) in 2021 to RMB8.6&nbsp;billion (US$1.2&nbsp;billion) in 2026. As a leader in the RTC/RTH space,
given the recent partnership with PFI Foods, a leading China-based alternative meat manufacturer, and a Board of Directors and advisory
network with significant operating and domain expertise, we should be able to identify and pivot to cater to evolving customer trends
and consumption behavior.</P>

food and e-commerce industries in China are highly competitive. We compete with different competitors in each of our business lines. Our
current and potential competitors can be divided into different categories: (i)&nbsp;traditional RTH, emerging RTC, and RTC food companies
(domestic and international) in China, (ii)&nbsp;major plant-based food companies in China, (iii)&nbsp;major content providers in China
focused on food, and (iv)&nbsp;other major internet companies in China that may enter the food-related content distribution or e-commerce
business area. There are certain barriers to entry that have limited the number and success of foreign entrants, emerging, and traditional-cum-emerging
brands, including our (i)&nbsp;brand awareness, (ii)&nbsp;E2E supply-chain visibility, (iii)&nbsp;strategic and preferred service agreements
with product and distribution partners, (iv)&nbsp;product R&amp;D and go-to-market capabilities, and (v)&nbsp;board of directors and advisory

Strategy</I>&nbsp;&#8212;</B>&nbsp;During the first half of the fiscal year, the Company adopted a Bitcoin accumulation strategy as
part of its capital allocation framework. As of the reporting date, the Company held 1,083&nbsp;Bitcoin. The strategy&rsquo;s
objective is to optimize long-term shareholder value while maintaining prudent liquidity and risk management. The Company views
Bitcoin as a scarce digital commodity operating on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network without reliance on central monetary
authorities. Bitcoin&rsquo;s fixed supply of&nbsp;21&nbsp;million units and cryptographic transparency contribute to its
characteristic as &ldquo;digital gold.&rdquo; Management believes that Bitcoin&rsquo;s durability, divisibility, and portability
provide advantages as a long-term store of value compared to traditional reserve assets. However, the Company recognizes that
Bitcoin remains an emerging asset subject to high volatility, evolving regulation, and technological risks that could materially
affect its fair value and liquidity. In managing its treasury, the Company seeks a balanced approach to capital preservation,
liquidity, and appreciation potential. The investment in Bitcoin is intended as both a diversification measure and a hedge against
potential monetary debasement and inflationary pressures. The Company continuously reviews its digital-asset exposure, considering
market dynamics, custodial infrastructure, cybersecurity standards, and the evolving policy environment. The Company uses
institutional-grade custodians employing multi-signature cold-storage solutions and maintains internal controls designed to mitigate
operational, theft, and cybersecurity risks. Management periodically reviews compliance with these controls as part of its internal
audit processes. Overall, management believes the Bitcoin treasury strategy represents a disciplined response to broader
macroeconomic and structural changes in the global financial system. The approach is intended to preserve long-term corporate value
and financial flexibility while acknowledging the inherent risks and regulatory evolutions surrounding digital assets. The Company
will continue to evaluate its treasury composition, risk controls, and disclosure practices to align with prevailing standards and
investor expectations.</P>

the equity interests of PFI Food Industries Limited by issuing our own financial instruments including redeemable convertible preferred
shares and warrants to acquire those redeemable convertible preferred shares. These financial instruments were issued in August&nbsp;2021
before we obtained the equity investment in PFI and were determined as non-derivative forward contracts measured at fair value. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2024, we made a qualitative assessment and considered there to be impairment indicators that investment in PFI was impaired
as it was significantly behind the forecasted revenue growth target and there was a declining trend of the plant-based meat industry performance.
As a result, the investment in PFI was written down to its fair value. In determining the fair value of the PFI investment, we made estimates
and judgments in determining the fair value regarding the cash flow forecasts of PFI, the weighted average cost of capital and the discount
for lack of marketability applied to the projected cash flows. As we do not have significant influence over PFI, we elected to measure
investment in PFI, without a readily determinable fair value, subsequently at cost adjusted for changes resulting from impairments, if
any, and observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer.</P>

financial reporting process to address complex U.S.&nbsp;GAAP accounting issues and related disclosures, in accordance with U.S.&nbsp;GAAP
and SEC financial reporting requirements. We are in the process of implementing a number of measures to address the material weakness
identified, including: (1)&nbsp;hiring additional accounting and financial reporting personnel with U.S.&nbsp;GAAP and SEC financial reporting
experience, (2)&nbsp;expanding the capabilities of existing accounting and financial reporting personnel through continuous training and
education in the accounting and financial reporting requirements under U.S.&nbsp;GAAP, and SEC rules and regulations, (3)&nbsp;establishing
clear roles and responsibilities to develop and implement formal comprehensive financial period-end closing policies and procedures to
ensure all transactions are properly recorded and disclosed, and (4)&nbsp;establishing effective monitoring and oversight controls for
non-recurring and complex transactions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We are in the process of sourcing for additional personnel suitable for the role, but we do not expect a material cash requirement to
arise from the remediation efforts. As of June 30, 2025, we have completed the optimization of the relevant internal controls.</P>

are transacted in RMB, which is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. On January&nbsp;1, 1994, the PRC government abolished
the dual rate system and introduced a single rate of exchange as quoted daily by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China. However, the unification
of the exchange rates does not imply the convertibility of RMB into USD or other foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions
continue to take place either through the People&rsquo;s Bank of China or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at
the exchange rates quoted by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China. Approval of foreign currency payments by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China

the convenient meal solutions market providing RTE, RTC and RTH products to our customers. With (i)&nbsp;the proliferation of food delivery
service options, (ii)&nbsp;a shift in customer preference and behavior away from home-cooked&nbsp;to convenience, and (iii)&nbsp;an increase
in GDP per capita/overall disposable income (both in our target demographic and in-general) the demand for convenient meal solution products
including RTC/RTE products has increased significantly. Customers have also become more discerning and expect RTC/RTH/RTE products to
be of a high quality, have a higher nutritional value, and taste better when compared with other processed or semi-processed&nbsp;food
product categories. Typically, RTC and RTE meals are made using high-quality&nbsp;and seasonal ingredients with full traceability at
every stage of the food chain and a focus on nutritional value and maintaining a balanced diet is factored into the recipe and product
R&amp;D process.</P>

number of customers are in pursuit of a healthier lifestyle and favor healthier ready-to-cook&nbsp;products instead of RTC products of
high calories as well as healthier ready-to-eat&nbsp;products instead of junk food. Chinese companies in the RTC and RTE industry, because
of their well-established&nbsp;value chains, are able to offer RTC and RTE products of competitive prices in markets like North America
and Europe despite the additional logistic expenses. Thus, Chinese companies that are actively seeking international expansion opportunities
are well positioned to gain share in the global RTC and RTE market.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Bitcoin is a digital asset
that is issued by and transmitted through an open-source protocol, known as the Bitcoin protocol, collectively maintained by a peer-to-peer
network of decentralized user nodes. This network hosts a public transaction ledger, known as the Bitcoin blockchain, on which bitcoin
holdings and all validated transactions that have ever taken place on the Bitcoin network are recorded. Balances of bitcoin are stored
in individual &ldquo;wallet&rdquo; functions, which associate network public addresses with one or more &ldquo;private keys&rdquo; that
control the transfer of bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain can be updated without any single entity owning or operating the network.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The Bitcoin protocol limits
the total number of bitcoins that can be generated over time to 21&nbsp;million. As of July&nbsp;15, 2025, approximately 19.9&nbsp;million
bitcoins have been generated. New bitcoins are created and allocated by the Bitcoin protocol through a &ldquo;mining&rdquo; process that
rewards users that validate transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain. Validated transactions are added in &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; approximately
every 10 minutes. The mining process serves to validate transactions and secure the Bitcoin network. Mining is a competitive and costly
operation that requires a large amount of computational power to solve complex mathematical algorithms. This expenditure of computing
power is known as &ldquo;proof of work.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">To incentivize miners to incur
the costs of mining bitcoin, the Bitcoin protocol rewards miners that successfully validate a block of transactions with newly generated
bitcoin. The current reward for miners that successfully validate a block of transactions is 3.125 bitcoin per mined block. The mining
reward is reduced by half, which is referred to as a bitcoin halving, after every 210,000 blocks are mined. This has historically occurred
approximately every four years. The most recent bitcoin halving occurred in April&nbsp;2024, and the next bitcoin halving is expected
to occur sometime in 2028.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Bitcoin is an open-source network
that has no central authority, so no one person can unilaterally make changes to the software that runs the network. However, there is
a core group of developers that maintains the code for the Bitcoin protocol, and they can propose changes to the source code and release
periodic updates and other changes. Unlike most software that has a central entity that can push updates to users, bitcoin is a peer-to-peer
network in which individual network participants, called nodes, decide whether to upgrade the software and accept the new changes. As
a practical matter, a modification becomes part of the Bitcoin protocol only if the proposed changes are accepted by participants collectively
having more than 50% of the processing power, known as hash rate, on the network. If a certain percentage of the nodes reject the changes,
then a &ldquo;fork&rdquo; takes place, and participants can choose the version of the software they want to run.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Blockchain technology has many
built-in security features that make it difficult for hackers and other malicious actors to corrupt the protocol or blockchain. However,
as with any computer network, the Bitcoin network may be subject to certain attacks. Some forms of attack include unauthorized access
to wallets that hold bitcoin and direct attacks, like &ldquo;51% attacks&rdquo; or &ldquo;denial-of-service attacks&rdquo; on the Bitcoin
network.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Bitcoin is controllable only
by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key(s)&nbsp;relating to the local or online digital wallet in which the bitcoin
is held. Private keys used to access bitcoin balances are not widely distributed and are typically held on hardware (which can be physically
controlled by the holder or by a third party such as a custodian) or via software programs on third-party servers. One form of obtaining
unauthorized access to a wallet occurs following a phishing attack where the attacker deceives the victim and manipulates them into sharing
their private keys for their digital wallet or other sensitive information. Other similar attacks may also result in the loss of private
keys and the inability to access, and effective loss of, the corresponding bitcoin. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;Risks Related
to Our Bitcoin Strategy and Holdings&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;We face risks relating to the custody of our bitcoin, including the loss or destruction
of private keys required to access our bitcoin and cyberattacks or other data loss relating to our bitcoin.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">A &ldquo;51% attack&rdquo;
may occur when a group of miners attain more than 50% of the Bitcoin network&rsquo;s mining power, thereby enabling them to control the
Bitcoin network and protocol and manipulate the blockchain. A &ldquo;denial-of-service attack&rdquo; occurs when legitimate users are
unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious actor flooding the network
with traffic until the network is unable to respond or crashes. The Bitcoin network has been, and can be in the future, subject to denial-of-service
attacks, which can result in temporary delays in block creation and in the transfer of bitcoin. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;Risks

of shares of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (&ldquo;ETPs&rdquo;) on U.S.&nbsp;national securities exchanges. While the SEC had
previously approved exchange-traded funds where the underlying assets were bitcoin futures contracts, this order represented the first
time the SEC approved the listing and trading of ETPs that acquire, hold and sell bitcoin directly. ETPs can be bought and sold on a
stock exchange like traditional stocks, and provide investors with another means of gaining economic exposure to bitcoin through traditional

asset exchanges provide trading venues for purchases and sales of bitcoin in exchange for fiat or other digital assets. Bitcoin can be
exchanged for fiat currencies, such as the U.S.&nbsp;dollar, at rates of exchange determined by market forces on bitcoin trading platforms,
which are not regulated in the same manner as traditional securities exchanges. In addition to these platforms, over-the-counter markets
and derivatives markets for bitcoin also exist. The value of bitcoin within the market is determined, in part, by the supply of and demand
for bitcoin in the global bitcoin market, market expectations for the adoption of bitcoin as a store of value, the number of merchants
that accept bitcoin as a form of payment, and the volume of peer-to-peer transactions, among other factors. For a discussion of risks
associated with digital asset exchanges, see &ldquo;Risk Factors&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;Risks Related to Our Bitcoin Strategy and Holdings&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;Due to
the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of many bitcoin trading venues, bitcoin trading venues may

bitcoin was the largest digital asset by market capitalization. However, numerous alternative digital assets exist, and many entities,
including consortia and financial institutions, are actively researching and investing resources in blockchain platforms and digital assets
that utilize consensus mechanisms other than proof-of-work mining, which is employed by the Bitcoin network. For example, in late 2022,
the Ethereum network transitioned to a &ldquo;proof-of-stake&rdquo; mechanism for validating transactions that requires significantly
less computing power than proof-of-work mining. Other alternative digital assets include &ldquo;stablecoins,&rdquo; which are designed
to maintain a constant price because of their issuers&rsquo; promise to hold high-quality liquid assets (such as U.S.&nbsp;dollar deposits
and short-term U.S.&nbsp;treasury securities) equal to the total value of stablecoins in circulation.</P>

of the global volume every year, which provides a significant

going forward for the Company in order for us to execute on the multi-brand strategy and also further diversify away from brand concentration
risks and into markets outside of China. Historically, virtually all of our sales have been in China. M&amp;A is an important part of
our strategy to establish our footprint and sales channel internationally. We are actively looking at potential targets with revenues
in the U.S., Europe, Australia, SE Asia, and Middle East. Since July&nbsp;2023, we have acquired three Asian food brand companies in the
U.S.&nbsp;including Nona Lim and Yai&rsquo;s Thai. Looking forward, we will continue to identify targets but to the extent permitted due
to our recurring losses from operations and an accumulated deficit, we will evaluate and opportunistically execute on strategic joint
ventures (JV), potential investments and acquisition opportunities across the value-chain&nbsp;with a focus on supplementing and/or complementing
our existing products, sales channels, customer-base&nbsp;and/or allow us to optimize our existing brand marketing and sales channel management
capabilities. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in generating revenues internationally. For example, our M&amp;A strategy
may not identify M&amp;A candidates and acquisitions that are completed may not be successfully integrated into our operations and may
not produce significant international revenues. Apart from executing acquisitions with considerations paid through share exchanges, we will consider raising funds from
investors to have an option to acquire companies through a mixture of cash and equity.</P>

unique attributes&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;scarcity, durability, divisibility, and global accessibility&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;that make it a suitable
asset for capital preservation. Accordingly, we allocate a significant portion of our excess capital resources to bitcoin purchases, intending
to hold such digital assets indefinitely. The treasury strategy is guided by a disciplined framework emphasizing accumulation at attractive
valuations, risk management through diversification of capital sources, and adherence to robust custody and security protocols.</P>

start before and continue beyond product launch. For pre-launch, we create original multi-media&nbsp;content to educate users on the product(s)&nbsp;and
to create user interest. At and after product launch, we shift to live streaming to promote our products, engaging KOL partners to live-stream&nbsp;product
launches or special sales events on their personal online channels or inviting them to our branded experience stores to live-stream&nbsp;the
product launches or special sales events on-site. For special occasions or festivals, we may invite top KOL partners to our headquarters
or other corporate locations, such as factories of supply chain partners, to live-stream&nbsp;special sales events, which usually lead
to record sales numbers during the livestream. We would also leverage the capabilities of our in-house&nbsp;content creation. For example,
in our cooperation with KOLs, our in-house&nbsp;content creation team may provide the KOLs with our own marketing materials, such as video
scripts and photos, for the KOLs to publish on their own platform. This can ensure that the marketing information would be accurate and
at the same time reduces our costs as we do not need to rely on third party to produce the relevant marketing material for us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The food and e-commerce&nbsp;industries
in China are highly competitive. We compete with different competitors in each of our business lines. Our current and potential competitors
can be divided into different categories: (i)&nbsp;traditional RTH and emerging RTC food companies in China, (ii)&nbsp;major plant-based&nbsp;food
companies in China, (iii)&nbsp;major content providers in China focused on food and (iv)&nbsp;other major internet companies in China
that may enter the food-related&nbsp;content distribution or e-commerce&nbsp;business area.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">When it comes to traditional
versus emerging RTC companies, the main differences are emerging RTC companies (i)&nbsp;operate more of an asset-light model, (ii)&nbsp;tend
to focus on R&amp;D, (iii)&nbsp;engage in more sophisticated customer segmentation and predictive analytics, and (iv)&nbsp;primarily engage
their target customer through one or more livestreaming, video-sharing, and/or content-marketing platforms.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">When it comes to plant-based
products, while foreign entrants have historically benefited from mature production technology for plant-based meat, many have struggled
to (i)&nbsp;establish an E2E integrated supply chain and distribution network in China, (ii)&nbsp;localize product formulas including
identifying the appropriate flavor, spice, and ingredient combinations that mesh with the fast-evolving tastes and preferences of the
Chinese consumer, and (iii)&nbsp;offer one or more products at an affordable price-point. When compared with foreign entrants, local players,
us included have a better pulse on customer preferences, the correct product pricing strategy, and GTM approach, which significantly de-risks/reduces
the likelihood of a customer-product mismatch.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">There are several key barriers-to-entry&nbsp;that
have limited the number and success of foreign entrants, emerging, and traditional-cum-emerging&nbsp;brands that can and do compete directly
with us. These include (i)&nbsp;brand awareness&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;we have a significant offline sales network (i.e. supermarkets, key
local/national key accounts, convenience stores etc.,) in non-tier&nbsp;1 cities in China and key partnerships with multiple online social
commerce/live and video-streaming/content marketing platforms, (ii)&nbsp;strategic&nbsp;&amp; preferred service agreements with product&nbsp;&amp;
distribution partners; (iii)&nbsp;E2E supply-chain&nbsp;visibility and predictive analytics capabilities that allow for real-time&nbsp;optimization
of one or multiple aspects of the supply-chain, (iv)&nbsp;an agile, data-driven&nbsp;product R&amp;D (8&nbsp;weeks from concept-to-shelf)
process&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;faster GTM when compared with both traditional&nbsp;&amp; emerging players, and (v)&nbsp;a Board of Directors
and Advisory Council with deep domain, relevant market and operator expertise, and network for partnership/M&amp;A origination purposes.</P>

chain and therefore we would actively look for suppliers who manage our manufacturing partners network efficiently. As of June&nbsp;30,
2025, our PRC suppliers network comprises 471 supply chain partners for our existing products portfolio. Sometimes we would co-develop&nbsp;products
with our selected suppliers&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;our product innovation team is responsible for recipe innovation which will then be passed
to our partner-suppliers&nbsp;for recipe standardization in preparation for mass production. Upon our confirmation, our partner-suppliers&nbsp;will
then proceed to production. We have also established warehouses and strategic co-manufacturers&nbsp;at a number of locations in the US

logistics. We manage other aspects of the supply chain process, including customer service, refunds, and exchanges. This model (i)&nbsp;reduces
the need for us to store inventory, which reduces fulfilment costs and inventory obsolescence risk, (ii)&nbsp;reduces turnaround and shipment
response time, and (iii)&nbsp;guarantees the freshness of products shipped to our customers, which are often perishable.</P>

which are often our distribution partners e.g., offline retail chains and supermarkets, we typically adopt a bulk shipment model, under
which supply chain partners are engaged to produce our products in bulk. We manage parts of inventory storage and delivery of these products
to the distribution partners. We typically engage, at our own costs, third-party&nbsp;inventory management companies and logistics companies
to manage our inventory and handle logistics. We ship bulk orders of our products to distribution partners. These products are then sold
to end customers. Customer service and quality assurance responsibilities for these products typically fall on the businesses selling
the products to end customers, with refunds and returns handled by the businesses directly.</P>

of COVID-19&nbsp;(and future pandemics) and other business disruptions (e.g. geopolitical or trade conflicts, natural disasters, or cybercrime
etc), we have taken and will continue to take proactive steps to diversify our supply chain, moving away from single-sourcing&nbsp;to
a network of diverse, alternative, pre-qualified&nbsp;suppliers of raw materials needed to produce one or more of our products. This approach
allows us to secure more favorable commercial terms with our existing suppliers and also reduces the risk of business disruption at one

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Selling food for human consumption
poses inherent legal and regulatory challenges and there is growing government oversight and public awareness regarding food safety regulations
and practices in China. Our internal processes, training, quality control, food safety measures and processes may not be effective in
preventing the contamination of our food products, which could lead to instances of food-borne&nbsp;illness (e.g., E. coli, listeria,
or salmonella). Unexpected side-effects, illness, injury, or death related to allergens, food-borne&nbsp;illnesses, voluntary or forced
recall of one or more products and/or lapses in food safety could result in a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and quality of
our products, which could materially impact our financial position, lead to the discontinuation of our business, or cause irreparable
reputational damage. If we or any one of our suppliers or distribution partners are found to be or are considered non-compliant&nbsp;with
food safety regulations, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) could institute enforcement and/or require a remediation
framework and timeline, which could result in additional cost and/or an extended disruption to the manufacturing of our products. The
shipment of adulterated or mislabelled products, even if inadvertent could result in criminal or civil liability. Food companies are also
periodically targeted by large-scale&nbsp;tampering as well as opportunistic individual product tampering. This type of tampering may
include product substitution and/or the introduction of foreign materials, objects, chemical contaminants, or pathogens into one or more
consumer products.</P>

and improvement, prescribe the use of the highest quality ingredients, and conduct internal audits regularly. Our food safety and quality

A multi-brand strategy puts the company is a good position to serve a wider spectrum of consumers across different pricing segmentations.
It also allows the company to provide a wider and more representative range of Asian Food products to global customers. The company&rsquo;s
M&amp;A strategy focuses on acquisition complimentary brands in the Asian Food category and also targets that can expand and strengthen
the company&rsquo;s sales network globally. M&amp;A is an important part of our strategy to establish our footprint and sales channel
internationally. We are actively looking at potential targets in the US, Europe, Australia, SE Asia, and Middle East. Historically, virtually
all of our sales on been in China. For example, our international sales were zero in 2022, 4.21% in 2023 and 10.14% of our total revenue
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2024. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in generating revenues internationally.
For example, our M&amp;A strategy may not identify M&amp;A candidates and acquisitions that are completed may not be successfully integrated
into our operations and may not produce significant international revenues.</P>

Law, effective on September&nbsp;18, 2008, provide requirements concerning employment contracts between an employer and its employees.
If an employer fails to enter into a written employment contract with an employee within one year from the date on which the employment
relationship is established, the employer must rectify the situation by entering into a written employment contract with the employee
and pay the employee twice the employee&rsquo;s salary for the period from the&nbsp;day following the lapse of one month from the date
of establishment of the employment relationship to the&nbsp;day prior to the execution of the written employment contract. The Labor Contract
Law and its implementation rules also require compensation to be paid upon certain terminations, which significantly affects the cost
of reducing workforce for employers. In addition, if an employer intends to enforce a non-compete&nbsp;provision in an employment contract
or non-competition&nbsp;agreement with an employee, it has to compensate the employee on a monthly basis during the term of the restriction
period after the termination or expiry of the labor contract. Employers in most cases are also required to provide severance payment to
their employees after their employment relationships are terminated.</P>

conversion of foreign currency-registered&nbsp;capital into RMB by foreign-invested&nbsp;enterprises by restricting how the
converted Renminbi may be used. The SAFE Circular 142 provided the registered capital of a foreign-invested&nbsp;enterprise,
converted into Renminbi from foreign currencies, might only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the
applicable government authority, and such Renminbi capital might not be used for equity investments within China unless otherwise
permitted by PRC law. The SAFE also strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the Renminbi capital converted from foreign
currency registered capital of foreign-invested&nbsp;enterprises. The use of such Renminbi capital might not be changed without
SAFE&rsquo;s approval, and such Renminbi capital might not in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans
had not been used. On March&nbsp;30, 2015, the SAFE issued the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming
the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested&nbsp;Enterprises, or the SAFE Circular&nbsp;19,
which took effective and replaced the SAFE Circular 142 on June&nbsp;1, 2015. Although the SAFE Circular 19 allows for the use of
Renminbi converted from the foreign currency-denominated&nbsp;capital for equity investments in China, prohibitions continued to
apply as to foreign-invested&nbsp;enterprises&rsquo; use of the converted Renminbi for (i)&nbsp;purposes beyond the business scope

otherwise provided by laws and regulations, (iii)&nbsp;providing entrusted loans in RMB (except where the business scope permits),

to third parties, (iv)&nbsp;paying the related expenses of purchasing real estate not for self-use&nbsp;except for
foreign-invested&nbsp;real estate enterprises. The SAFE later promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement Management Policy of Capital Account, or Circular&nbsp;16, which
became effective on June&nbsp;9, 2016, reiterates and replaces some of the rules set forth in Circular 19. For instance, Circular 16
alleviates the restrictions on using Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency-denominated&nbsp;registered capital of a
foreign-invested&nbsp;company to issue Renminbi entrusted loans, replacing it with a prohibition against using such capital to issue
loans to non-associated&nbsp;enterprises. According to SAFE Circular&nbsp;16, the foreign exchange receipts under the capital
account of a domestic institution shall be used pursuant to the principle of authenticity and self-use&nbsp;within its business
scope. The foreign exchange receipts under the capital account of a domestic institution and the Renminbi funds obtained from
foreign exchange settlement may be used by the domestic institution for expenditures under the current account within its business
scope or the expenditure under the capital account permitted by laws and regulations. Such receipts and funds of the domestic
institutions shall not be used for the following purposes: (i)&nbsp;directly or indirectly used for payment beyond the business
scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations; (ii)&nbsp;directly or indirectly used for
investment in securities or other investments than principal-secured&nbsp;products of banks unless otherwise provided by relevant
laws and regulations; (iii)&nbsp;directly or indirectly used for granting the granting of loans to non-affiliated&nbsp;enterprises,
with the exception that such granting is expressly permitted in the business license; and (iv)&nbsp;used for construction or
purchase of real estate for purpose other than self-use&nbsp;(exception applies for real estate enterprises). Where there is any
contractual agreement on the use scope of receipt under the capital account between a domestic institution and other parties
involved, the domestic institution shall not use such receipts and funds beyond the scope. Violations of the SAFE Circular 19 or
Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties.</P>

or indirect offshore investments in overseas SPVs. Under the SAFE Circular&nbsp;37, a SPV refers to an offshore entity, directly established
or indirectly controlled by PRC residents, for the purpose of offshore investment and financing, using their legitimate domestic or offshore
assets or interests. Such PRC residents also required to amend their registrations with the SAFE when the basic information of registered
SPVs changes (including change of the PRC residents, name and operating period of the SPV), or when such change is a significant (including
PRC residents&rsquo; increase or decrease of capital contribution in the SPV, transfer or exchange of shares, and merger or division
of the SPV). Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in the SAFE Circular 37 may result in restrictions on the relevant
onshore company&rsquo;s ability to conduct foreign exchange activities. Such restrictions include limiting payment of dividends and other
distributions to an onshore company&rsquo;s offshore parent or affiliate, restricting capital inflow from the offshore entities and settlement
of foreign exchange capital, and may subject relevant onshore company or PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration
regulations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Governments around the world
have reacted differently to digital assets; certain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade
without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as the U.S., digital assets are subject to overlapping, uncertain and evolving
regulatory requirements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">As digital assets have grown
in both popularity and market size, the U.S.&nbsp;Executive Branch, Congress and a number of U.S.&nbsp;federal and state agencies, including
the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&ldquo;CFTC&rdquo;), the SEC, the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the IRS and state financial regulators, have been examining the operations of digital asset networks, digital
asset users and digital asset exchanges, with particular focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to violate state or federal
laws, including to facilitate the laundering of proceeds of illegal activities or the funding of criminal or terrorist enterprises, and
the safety and soundness and consumer-protective safeguards of exchanges or other service-providers that hold, transfer, trade or exchange
digital assets for users. Many of these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital
assets to investors. In addition, federal and state agencies, and other countries have issued rules or guidance regarding the treatment
of digital asset transactions and requirements for businesses engaged in activities related to digital assets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Depending on the regulatory
characterization of bitcoin, the markets for bitcoin in general, and our activities in particular, our business and our bitcoin strategy
may be subject to regulation by one or more regulators in the United&nbsp;States and globally. Ongoing and future regulatory actions may
alter, to a materially adverse extent, the nature of digital assets markets, the participation of industry participants, including service
providers and financial institutions in these markets, and our ability to pursue our bitcoin strategy. Additionally, U.S.&nbsp;state and
federal and foreign regulators and legislatures have taken action against industry participants, including digital assets businesses,
and enacted restrictive regimes in response to adverse publicity arising from hacks, consumer harm, or criminal activity stemming from
digital assets activity. U.S.&nbsp;federal and state energy regulatory authorities are also monitoring the total electricity consumption
of cryptocurrency mining, and the potential impacts of cryptocurrency mining to the supply and dispatch functionality of the wholesale
grid and retail distribution systems. Many state legislative bodies have passed, or are actively considering, legislation
to address the impact of cryptocurrency mining in their respective states.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The CFTC takes the
position that some digital assets, including bitcoin, fall within the definition of a &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; under the Commodities
Exchange&nbsp;Act&nbsp;of&nbsp;1936, as amended (the &ldquo;CEA&rdquo;). Under the CEA, the CFTC has broad enforcement authority to
police market manipulation and fraud in spot digital assets markets in which we may transact. Beyond instances of fraud or
manipulation, the CFTC generally does not oversee cash or spot market exchanges or transactions involving digital asset commodities
that do not utilize margin, leverage, or financing. In addition, CFTC regulations and CFTC oversight and enforcement authority apply
with respect to futures, swaps, other derivative products and certain retail leveraged commodity transactions involving digital
asset commodities, including the markets on which these products trade.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The SEC and its staff have
taken the position that certain other digital assets fall within the definition of a &ldquo;security&rdquo; under the U.S.&nbsp;federal
securities laws. Public statements made by senior officials and senior members of the staff at the SEC indicate that the SEC does not
consider bitcoin to be a security under the federal securities laws. However, such statements are not official policy statements by the
SEC and reflect only the speakers&rsquo; views, which are not binding on the SEC or any other agency or court and cannot be generalized
to any other digital assets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">In addition, since transactions
in bitcoin provide a degree of anonymity, they are susceptible to misuse for criminal activities, such as money laundering. This misuse,
or the perception of such misuse, could lead to greater regulatory oversight of bitcoin and Bitcoin platforms, and there is the possibility
that law enforcement agencies could close or blacklist bitcoin platforms or other bitcoin-related infrastructure with little or no notice
and prevent users from accessing or retrieving bitcoin held via such platforms or infrastructure. For example, the U.S.&nbsp;Treasury
Department&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued updated advisories regarding the use of virtual currencies, added a number
of digital asset exchanges and service providers to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list and engaged in several
enforcement actions, including a series of enforcement actions that have either shut down or significantly curtailed the operations of
several smaller digital asset exchanges associated with Russian and/or North Korean nationals. Additionally, in January&nbsp;2025, the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that it is seeking public input on privacy protections and surveillance in digital payments,
particularly those offered through large technology platforms.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">As noted above, activities
involving bitcoin and other digital assets may fall within the jurisdiction of more than one financial regulator and various courts and
such laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope. On January&nbsp;23, 2025, President Trump issued an executive
order titled, Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology. While the executive order did not mandate the adoption
of any specific regulations, the executive order identifies certain key objectives to guide agencies involved in crypto regulation, including
(i)&nbsp;protecting the sovereignty of the United&nbsp;States dollar by promoting the development of United&nbsp;States dollar-backed
stablecoins, (ii)&nbsp;providing regulatory clarity and certainty built on technology-neutral regulations for individuals and firms involved
in digital assets, including through well-defined jurisdictional regulatory boundaries, and (iii)&nbsp;taking measures to protect Americans
from the risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies. To achieve these objectives, the executive order established a working group on digital
asset markets within the National Economic Council, comprised of representatives from key federal agencies, with a tight timeline for
examining existing regulations and proposing a new regulatory framework. There have also been several bills introduced in Congress that
propose to establish additional regulation and oversight of the digital asset markets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">In this context, in the United&nbsp;States,
the &ldquo;Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S.&nbsp;Stablecoins Act&nbsp;of&nbsp;2025&rdquo; (GENIUS Act) introduces
a federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. The legislation requires issuers to obtain either a federal or state license,
maintain full reserve backing in U.S.&nbsp;dollars or short-term U.S.&nbsp;Treasury instruments, and comply with enhanced transparency,
capital adequacy, and risk management standards. The Act prohibits the misrepresentation of stablecoins as legal tender and mandates alignment
between state and federal regulatory regimes. A reconciliation process with the House&rsquo;s STABLE Act is ongoing, with a unified federal
statute anticipated by the end of 2025.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">In Hong&nbsp;Kong, the
Stablecoin Bill, enacted in May&nbsp;2025 and effective August&nbsp;1, establishes a licensing regime under the Hong&nbsp;Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) for fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers. The legislation mandates full reserve backing, same-day redemption at par value,
and the segregation of client assets. It prohibits unlicensed issuance and retail marketing, and imposes Basel-aligned liquidity and
anti-money laundering requirements. The framework is designed to integrate with Hong&nbsp;Kong&rsquo;s broader virtual asset regulatory
regime. In the European Union, the Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCA), fully effective since December&nbsp;2024, prohibits algorithmic
stablecoins and requires fiat-backed tokens to maintain high-quality liquid reserves. Further regulatory developments in the EU are expected
to focus on supervisory harmonization and potential expansion to decentralized finance-linked stablecoins.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Under Cayman Islands law,
our directors owe fiduciary duties to our Company. These include, among others (i)&nbsp;duty to act in good faith in what the
director believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole; (ii)&nbsp;duty to exercise powers for the purposes for
which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral purpose; (iii)&nbsp;directors should not improperly fetter the exercise
of future discretion; (iv)&nbsp;duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the
company and their personal interests; and (v)&nbsp;duty to exercise independent judgment. In addition to the above, our directors
also owe a duty to act with skill, care and diligence. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent
person having both the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same
functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience which that
director has. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill
and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands. In fulfilling their duty of care to us, our
directors must ensure compliance with our Memorandum and Articles, as amended from time to time. Our Company has the right to seek
damages if a duty owed by any of our directors is breached. In limited exceptional circumstances, a shareholder may have the right
to seek damages in our name if a duty owed by our directors is breached.</P>

have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit
as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized
in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted
in the Memorandum and Articles, as amended from time to time or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Under the PRC EIT Law and its
implementation rules, an enterprise established outside the PRC with a &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; within the PRC is considered
a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The implementation rules
define the term &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; as the body that exercises full and substantial control over and overall management
of the business, production, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April&nbsp;2009, the SAT issued the Circular of the
SAT on Issues Relating to Identification of PRC-Controlled&nbsp;Overseas Registered Enterprises as Resident Enterprises in Accordance
With the De Facto Standards of Organizational Management, or SAT Circular&nbsp;82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining
whether the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; of a PRC-controlled&nbsp;enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China.
Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled
by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the SAT&rsquo;s general position on how the &ldquo;de
facto management body&rdquo; test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to SAT
Circular&nbsp;82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC
tax resident by virtue of having its &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; in the PRC only if all of the following conditions are met:
(i)&nbsp;the primary location of the&nbsp;day-to-day&nbsp;operational management is in the PRC; (ii)&nbsp;decisions relating to the enterprise&rsquo;s
financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii)&nbsp;the enterprise&rsquo;s
primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC;
and (iv)&nbsp;at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.</P>

the SAT issued the SAT Bulletin&nbsp;45, which took effect in September&nbsp;2011, to provide more guidance on the implementation of SAT
Circular 82. SAT Bulletin 45 provides for procedures and administration details of determination on resident status and administration
on post-determination&nbsp;matters. Although SAT Circular 82 and SAT Bulletin 45 only apply to offshore incorporated enterprises controlled
by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups and not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, and we are not controlled by a
PRC enterprise or PRC enterprise group, the determination criteria set forth therein may reflect the SAT&rsquo;s general position on how
the term &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; could be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless
of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises, individuals or foreigners.</P>

Company is a company incorporated outside the PRC.&nbsp;As a holding company, its sole assets are share ownerships of its direct
subsidiaries incorporated in Hong&nbsp;Kong, the Cayman Islands and the United&nbsp;States, and its key assets are located, and its
records (including the resolutions of its board of directors and the resolutions of its shareholders) are maintained, outside the
PRC.&nbsp;As such, we do not believe that our Company meets all of the conditions above or is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax
purposes. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties
remain with respect to the interpretation of the term &ldquo;de facto management body.&rdquo; There can be no assurance that the PRC
government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">If the PRC tax authorities
determine that our Cayman Islands holding company or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise
income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. For example, first, a 25% PRC enterprise income tax would
be imposed on our worldwide income. Second, a 10% withholding tax would be imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC&nbsp;enterprise
shareholders. In addition, non-resident&nbsp;enterprise shareholders may be subject to PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other
disposition of Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares, as if such income is treated as sourced from within the PRC.&nbsp;Furthermore, if we are
deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid to our non-PRC&nbsp;individual shareholders and any gain realized on the transfer of
ordinary shares by such shareholders may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 20% (which, in the case of dividends, may be withheld at source
by us).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">If we are considered a &ldquo;non-resident&nbsp;enterprise&rdquo;
by the PRC tax authorities, the dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiaries will be subject to a 10% withholding tax. The EIT Law also
imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside
of China, if such immediate holding company is considered as a non-resident&nbsp;enterprise without any establishment or place within
China or if the received dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate holding company within China,
unless such immediate holding company&rsquo;s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different
withholding arrangement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">These rates may be reduced
by an applicable tax treaty, but it is unclear whether in practice non-PRC&nbsp;shareholders of our Company would be able to obtain the
benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise.

discussion below under &ldquo;Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,&rdquo; any cash distributions (including the amount of any
PRC tax withheld) paid on our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined
under U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a U.S.&nbsp;Holder as dividend
income on the&nbsp;day actually or constructively received by the U.S.&nbsp;Holder. Because we do not intend to determine our
earnings and profits on the basis of U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax principles, any distribution we pay will generally be treated as a
&ldquo;dividend&rdquo; for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. A non-corporate&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Holder will be subject to tax on
dividend income from a &ldquo;qualified foreign corporation&rdquo; at a lower applicable capital gains rather than the marginal tax
rates generally applicable to ordinary income provided that certain holding period requirements are met. A non-U.S.&nbsp;corporation
(other than a corporation that is classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable
year) will generally be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (i)&nbsp;if it is eligible for the benefits of a
comprehensive tax treaty with the United&nbsp;States that the U.S.&nbsp;Secretary of Treasury determines is satisfactory for
purposes of this provision and includes an exchange of information program, or (ii)&nbsp;with respect to any dividend it pays on
stock that is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United&nbsp;States, including NYSE.&nbsp;It is unclear
whether dividends that we pay on our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares will meet the conditions required for the reduced tax rate.
However, in the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be eligible
for the benefits of the United&nbsp;States-PRC&nbsp;income tax treaty. If we are eligible for such benefits, dividends we pay on our
Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares, would be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation described in this paragraph. You are urged to
consult your tax advisor regarding the availability of the lower rate for dividends paid with respect to our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary
Shares. Dividends received on our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares will not be eligible for the dividends-received&nbsp;deduction
allowed to corporations.</P>

Depending on the U.S.&nbsp;Holder&rsquo;s individual facts and circumstances, a U.S.&nbsp;Holder may be eligible, subject to a number
of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit not in excess of any applicable treaty rate in respect of any foreign withholding
taxes imposed on dividends received on our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares. A U.S.&nbsp;Holder who does not elect to claim a foreign tax
credit for foreign tax withheld may instead claim a deduction, for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, in respect of such withholding,
but only for a year in which such U.S.&nbsp;Holder elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes. The rules governing the foreign
tax credit are complex and their outcome depends in large part on the U.S.&nbsp;Holder&rsquo;s individual facts and circumstances. Accordingly,
U.S.&nbsp;Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular

under &ldquo;Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,&rdquo; a U.S.&nbsp;Holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon the

and the U.S.&nbsp;Holder&rsquo;s adjusted tax basis in such Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares. Any capital gain or loss will be long term if

tax credit purposes. Long-term&nbsp;capital gains of non-corporate&nbsp;taxpayers are currently eligible for reduced rates of taxation.
In the event that gain from the disposition of the Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares is subject to tax in the PRC, such gain may be treated
as PRC-source&nbsp;gain under the United&nbsp;States-PRC&nbsp;income tax treaty. The deductibility of a capital loss may be subject to

taxable year, if either (i)&nbsp;75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of &ldquo;passive&rdquo;
income or (ii)&nbsp;50% or more of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is
attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, cash and cash equivalents
are categorized as passive assets and the company&rsquo;s goodwill and other unbooked intangibles are taken into account as
non-passive&nbsp;assets. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains
from the disposition of passive assets. We will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate
share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, more than 25% (by value) of the stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Based on our current composition
of assets, subsidiaries and market capitalization (which will fluctuate from time to time), we do not expect to be or become a PFIC for
U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. However, no assurance can be given in this regard because the determination of whether we will
be or become a PFIC is a factual determination made annually that will depend, in part, upon the composition of our income and assets.
Furthermore, the composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets and the cash
raised in our initial public offering. Under circumstances where our revenue from activities that produce passive income significantly
increase relative to our revenue from activities that produce non-passive&nbsp;income, or where we determine not to deploy significant
amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC may substantially increase. In addition, because there
are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service may challenge our classification
of certain income and assets as non-passive&nbsp;or our valuation of our tangible and intangible assets, each of which may result in our
becoming a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable&nbsp;years. If we were classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S.&nbsp;Holder
held our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares, we generally would continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding&nbsp;years during which
such U.S.&nbsp;Holder held our Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares even if we cease to be a PFIC in subsequent&nbsp;years, unless certain elections
are made.</P>

it was able expand the scope of its audit or conduct such further investigation. The Company conducted an internal investigation of these

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We are incorporated under the
laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We incorporated in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits
associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable
tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services.
However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared
to the securities laws of the United&nbsp;States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal
courts of the United&nbsp;States.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Most of our assets are located
in China and Hong&nbsp;Kong. All of our directors are located outside of the United&nbsp;States and except for Mr.&nbsp;Matthew Gene Mouw,
are all nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United&nbsp;States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets are
located outside of the United&nbsp;States. Ms. Norma Ka Yin Chu, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairwoman, is a permanent resident of
Hong&nbsp;Kong; and Samuel Chun Kong Shih, our independent director, is a permanent resident of Canada. As a result, it may be difficult
for investors to effect service of process within the United&nbsp;States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against
us or them judgments obtained in United&nbsp;States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
securities laws of the United&nbsp;States or any state in the United&nbsp;States.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We have been advised by
Travers Thorp Alberga that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the federal or
state courts of the United&nbsp;States (and the Cayman Islands are not a party to any treaties for the reciprocal enforcement or
recognition of such judgments), the Cayman Islands Grand Court will at common law enforce final and conclusive in personam judgments
of state and/or federal courts of the United&nbsp;States of America, or the Foreign Court, of a debt or definite sum of money
against the Company (other than a sum of money payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature, a fine or other
penalty (which may include a multiple damages judgment in an anti-trust action) or where enforcement would be contrary to public
policy). The Grand Court of the Cayman Islands will also at common law enforce final and conclusive in personam judgments of the
Foreign Court that are non-monetary against the Company, for example, declaratory judgments ruling upon the true legal owner of
shares in a Cayman Islands company. The Grand Court will exercise its discretion in the enforcement of non-money judgments by having
regard to the circumstances, such as considering whether the principles of comity apply. To be treated as final and conclusive, any
relevant judgment must be regarded as res judicata by the Foreign Court. A debt claim on a foreign judgment must be brought within
six&nbsp;years of the date of the judgment, and arrears of interest on a judgment debt cannot be recovered after six&nbsp;years from
the date on which the interest was due. The Cayman Islands courts are unlikely to enforce a judgment obtained from the Foreign Court
under civil liability provisions of U.S.&nbsp;federal securities law if such a judgment is found by the courts of the Cayman Islands
to give rise to obligations to make payments that are penal or punitive in nature. Such a determination has not yet been made by the
Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. A Cayman Islands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being
brought elsewhere. A judgment entered in default of appearance by a defendant who has had notice of the Foreign Court&rsquo;s
intention to proceed may be final and conclusive notwithstanding that the Foreign Court has power to set aside its own judgment and
despite the fact that it may be subject to an appeal the time-limit for which has not yet expired. The Grand Court may safeguard the
defendant&rsquo;s rights by granting a stay of execution pending any such appeal and may also grant interim injunctive relief as
appropriate for the purpose of enforcement.</P>

have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of DDC Enterprise Limited and its subsidiaries (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
as of December&nbsp;31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders&rsquo;
equity, and cash flows for each of the&nbsp;years ended December&nbsp;31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the &ldquo;consolidated financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the&nbsp;years ended December&nbsp;31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United&nbsp;States of America (&ldquo;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP&rdquo;).</FONT></P>

accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note&nbsp;2(b)&nbsp;to the consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of RMB157&nbsp;million, and net cash
used in operating activities of RMB112.9&nbsp;million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of RMB1.81&nbsp;billion,
that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters are
also described in Note&nbsp;2(b). The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.</FONT></P>

April&nbsp;1, 2022 the Company entered into a sale and purchase agreement as well as an agreement to terminate the Farm VIE Agreements
with Mr.&nbsp;Cui Yixiong and Ms. Wang Yike to transfer the Farm Entities to Mr.&nbsp;Cui Yixiong and Ms. Wang Yike for RMB1. The share
options previously issued to Mr.&nbsp;Cui Yixiong in connection with the acquisition of Farm Entities were returned and cancelled. At
the same time, the Company granted&nbsp;22,509&nbsp;new share options to Mr.&nbsp;Cui Yixiong. Upon the termination, the Company recognized
a gain from termination of the Farm Entities VIE arrangement of RMB13,116,960, which is measured as the difference between&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;the
consideration of RMB1 receivable, (ii)&nbsp;the incremental fair value of RMB1,424,721 of the share options exchanged on April&nbsp;1,
2022, and (iii)&nbsp;the carrying amount of Farm Entities&rsquo; net liabilities of RMB15,658,584, including goodwill of RMB1,116,904.
The disposal of the Farm Entities discontinued the Company&rsquo;s fresh products business. The Company&rsquo;s management believes that
the termination of the Farm VIE Agreements does not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company&rsquo;s operations
and financial results and is not accounted as discontinued operation.</FONT></P>

Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and the intangible assets and
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its asset may not be fully recoverable.
When these events occur, the Company measures impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted
cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying
amount of the asset over their fair value. Fair value is generally determined by discounting the cash flows expected to be generated
by the asset when the market prices are not readily available. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset is the new cost basis and is
depreciated over the asset&rsquo;s remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest
level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.</FONT></P>

is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might
be impaired. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers primary factors such as industry
and market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations.
If the Company decides, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The
quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying
amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded. Application of a goodwill
impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities
to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The judgment in estimating
the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit. The Company
performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level on December&nbsp;31 annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment
exist.</FONT></P>

January&nbsp;1, 2022, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic&nbsp;842 (ASC&nbsp;842), which requires that a lessee
recognize in the consolidated balance sheet a lease liability and a corresponding Right-of-use assets, including for those leases that
the Company currently classifies as operating leases. The Right-of-use assets and the lease liability was initially measured using the
present value of the remaining lease payments. ASC&nbsp;842 was implemented using a modified retrospective approach which resulted in
no cumulative-effect adjustment in the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of January&nbsp;1, 2022. As a result, the consolidated
balance sheet prior to January&nbsp;1, 2022 was not restated and continues to be reported under FASB ASC Topic&nbsp;840, &ldquo;Leases,&rdquo;
(&ldquo;ASC&nbsp;840&rdquo;), which did not require the recognition of a Right-of-use assets or lease liability for operating leases.
As permitted under ASC&nbsp;842, the Company adopted the following practical expedients: (1)&nbsp;not to reassess whether an expired
or non-lease contract that commenced before January&nbsp;1, 2022 contained an embedded lease, (2)&nbsp;not to reassess the classification
of existing leases, (3)&nbsp;not to determine whether initial direct costs related to existing leases should be capitalized under ASC&nbsp;842.</FONT></P>

Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or finance leases. Lease agreements mainly cover offices, warehouses
and equipment, most of these leases are operating leases; however, certain equipment from a third-party lessor are leased under finance
leases. Leased assets pursuant to operating leases are included in operating lease Right-of-use assets (&ldquo;ROU&rdquo;), while leased
assets pursuant to finance leases are included in property and equipment, net. The Company&rsquo;s lease agreements do not contain any
residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants. The Company reviews all relevant contracts to determine if the contract contains
a lease at its inception date. A contract contains a lease if the contract conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an
underlying asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the Company determines that a contract contains a lease, it recognizes,
in the consolidated balance sheets, a lease liability and a corresponding Right-of-use assets on the commencement date of the lease.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term using the rate implicit
in the lease or, if not readily determinable, the Company&rsquo;s secured incremental borrowing rate. An operating lease Right-of-use
assets is initially measured at the value of the lease liability minus any lease incentives and plus initial direct costs incurred and
any prepaid rent.</FONT></P>

sale contracts directly with individual customers or small retailers. These platforms do not take control of the goods or have sales
contracts with individual customers or small retailers. The Company is responsible for fulfilling all obligations according to the sales
contracts with end customers and small retailers, including delivering products, providing customer support and handling sales return.
The Company also has discretion in setting the price charged on individual customers or small retailers. Accordingly, the Company determined
that individual customers and small retailers (as opposed to the platforms) are the Company&rsquo;s customers. The sales contracts with
individual customers normally include a customer&rsquo;s right to return products within seven&nbsp;days after receipt of goods.</FONT></P>

Company determines whether an award should be classified and accounted for as a liability award or an equity award. Both liability-classified
awards and equity-classified awards are initially measured at their grant-date fair value. At each financial reporting date and ultimately
at settlement date, the fair value of a liability-classified award is remeasured. An equity-classified award is not remeasured after
grant date. If share-based awards are subject to both service conditions and the occurrence of an initial public offering (&ldquo;IPO&rdquo;)
as performance condition, cumulative share-based compensation expenses for the awards that have satisfied the service condition will
be recorded upon the completion of the IPO, using the graded-vesting method. The fair value of share options at the time of grant or
modification, if applicable, is determined using the binomial-lattice option pricing model. The Company elects to recognize the effect
of forfeitures as compensation costs when they occur. To the extent the required vesting conditions are not met resulting in the forfeiture
of the share-based awards, previously recognized compensation expense relating to those awards is reversed.</FONT></P>

Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Current income taxes are provided on the basis of income before
income taxes for financial reporting purposes and adjusted for income and expense items which are not assessable or deductible for income
tax purposes, in accordance with the regulations of the relevant tax jurisdictions. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax laws and rates expected to apply to taxable income in the&nbsp;years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in
the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance
is provided to reduce the amount of deferred income tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the
nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of futures profitability, the duration of statutory carry
forward periods, the Company&rsquo;s experience with operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, if any, not expiring.</FONT></P>

Company applies a &ldquo;more-likely-than-not&rdquo; recognition threshold in the evaluation of uncertain tax positions. The Company
recognizes the benefit of a tax position in its consolidated financial statements if the tax position is &ldquo;more-likely-than-not&rdquo;
to prevail based on the facts and technical merits of the position. Tax positions that meet the &ldquo;more-likely-than-not&rdquo; recognition
threshold is measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
Unrecognized tax benefits may be affected by changes in interpretation of laws, rulings of tax authorities, tax audits, and expiry of
statutory limitations. In addition, changes in facts, circumstances and new information may require the Company to adjust the recognition
and measurement estimates regarding individual tax positions. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits are periodically reviewed and re-assessed.
Adjustments, if required, are recorded in the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements in the period in which the change that
necessities the adjustments occur. The ultimate outcome for a particular tax position may not be determined
with certainty prior to the conclusion of a tax audit and, in certain circumstances, a tax appeal or litigation process. The Company
records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits (if any) in interest expenses and general and administrative expenses,
respectively.</FONT></P>

considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The update also
clarifies that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The update also
requires certain additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The amendments in this update
are effective for the Company beginning January&nbsp;1, 2024 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and

guidance in paragraph&nbsp;718-10-15-3 to determine whether profits interest and similar awards should be accounted for in accordance
with Topic&nbsp;718. Profits interest awards are provided to employees or nonemployees to align compensation with an entity&rsquo;s operating
performance and provide holders with the opportunity to participate in future profits and/or equity appreciation. This update applies

to December&nbsp;22, 2021, the Company determined the equity interests in PFI Foods to be transferred as a non-derivative prepaid forward
contract. The forward contract, the Series&nbsp;C-1 redeemable convertible preferred shares issued and PFI warrant was initially recorded
at their fair value of RMB94,141,160, RMB45,564,461&nbsp;and RMB48,576,699, respectively. The forward contract was recorded as an investment

in &ldquo;Changes in fair value of financial instruments&rdquo;, due to the overall under performance of the industry and PFI Food&rsquo;s
inability to obtain external financing in the poor economic environment. In determining the fair value of the investment in PFI Foods,
the Company made estimates and judgments regarding the cash flow forecasts of PFI Foods, the weighted average cost of capital of&nbsp;15.4%

the Company made a qualitative assessment and considered there were impairment indicators that investment in PFI Foods were impaired
as of December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, as it was significantly behind the forecasted revenue growth target and there has
been a declining trend of the plant-based meat industry performance. In determining the fair value of the investment in PFI Foods, the
Company made estimates and judgments regarding the cash flow forecasts of PFI Foods, the weighted average cost of capital of&nbsp;13.2%

Company assessed whether there were substantial changes of terms of the January&nbsp;2019 Shareholder Loan. If the terms are substantially
different, the modification is accounted for as a debt extinguishment. Otherwise, it is accounted for as a modification. In order to
determine whether the terms are substantially different upon each modification, the Company compared whether the present value of the
cash flows under the terms of the modified debt instrument is at least 10 percent different from the present value of the remaining cash
flows under the terms of the original debt instrument. If the terms of a non-convertible debt instrument are modified and the cash flow
effect on a present value basis is less than 10 percent, the debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different. The calculation
of the present value of the cash flows of the new debt instruments included all cash flows specified by the terms
of the new debt instruments plus any amounts paid by the Company. Those amounts paid by the Company were the fair value of new warrants
issued in the first modification, the incremental fair value resulted from the revision of the warrant terms in the second modification,
nil in the third modification and the excess of the fair value of Class&nbsp;A OS Warrant issued, over the fair value of the B-2&nbsp;&amp;
C Warrants cancelled, in the fourth modification.</FONT></P>

Company assessed whether there were substantial changes of terms of the August&nbsp;2021 Convertible Loan. If the terms are substantially
different, the modification is accounted for as a debt extinguishment. Otherwise, it is accounted for as a modification. In order to
determine whether the terms are substantially different upon each modification, the Company compared whether the present value of the
cash flows under the terms of the modified debt instrument is at least 10 percent different from the present value of the remaining cash
flows under the terms of the original debt instrument. If the terms of a non-convertible debt instrument are modified and the cash flow
effect on a present value basis is less than 10 percent, the debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different. The calculation
of the present value of the cash flows of the new debt instruments included all cash flows specified by the terms of the new debt instruments
plus any amounts paid by the Company.</FONT></P>

Company&rsquo;s shareholders and Board of Directors approved of employee option plans from 2014 to 2024 in order to provide incentives
and rewards to the Company&rsquo;s employees, directors, consultants and senior management (the &ldquo;Option Plans&rdquo;). As of December&nbsp;31,
2024, the Company authorized&nbsp;5,200,000&nbsp;share options under the Option Plan. Share options awarded under the Option Plan are
typically vested based on the service conditions up to four&nbsp;years agreed with each of the participants in their grant letters, with
exercise prices ranging from nominal consideration to US$9.06. In addition, the share options can only be exercised and converted into
shares upon the completion of Company&rsquo;s qualified IPO and exercise event which is a public offering or other form of listing (&ldquo;Exercise
Event&rdquo;), whichever is earlier, except for the modifications made in 2023 for two senior management members and&nbsp;14,586&nbsp;share
options granted to one senior management member in 2023. Each share option has a contractual life of&nbsp;10&nbsp;years.</FONT></P>

connection with the acquisition of the&nbsp;51% equity interest of Lishang in May&nbsp;2022, the Company may be required to grant share
options to Ms. Chen Di and two other her nominee shareholders (&ldquo;the Lishang Seller&rdquo;) at the end of each performance period,
adjusted based on the achievement of Lishang&rsquo;s revenue, gross profit and net profit for each of the four performance periods during
May&nbsp;1, 2022 to December&nbsp;31, 2024, over the target performance. If the IPO does not occur by January&nbsp;1, 2024, the Company
is obliged to pay RMB3.5&nbsp;million cash corresponding to&nbsp;30,984&nbsp;share options out of the total base number of&nbsp;43,936&nbsp;share
options to be issued for the third performance period. If the IPO does not occur by January&nbsp;1, 2025, the Company is obligated to
deliver a fixed amount of RMB12.4&nbsp;million cash in addition to the previous payment of RMB3.5&nbsp;million, with all previously issued
share options,
if any, cancelled. In August&nbsp;2023, the Company issued&nbsp;16,972&nbsp;share options to the Lishang Seller, based on the actual
performances of Lishang for the first two performance periods up to December&nbsp;31, 2022. As the Lishang Seller is required to continuously
provide services to Lishang for no less than three&nbsp;years after the acquisition, and as the Company is obligated to deliver cash
unless an IPO takes place, these share-based arrangements are accounted for as liability-classified award and were amortized over the
service period of the Lishang Seller based on the cash amount to be paid the IPO does not occur. The compensation cost recognized in
connection with this liability-classified award for the&nbsp;years ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2024&nbsp;amounted to RMB10,405,554&nbsp;respectively
and was recognised as non-current liabilities.</FONT></P>

expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of comparable peer public companies with a time horizon close to
the expected term of the Company&rsquo;s options. The risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the yield to maturity of U.S.&nbsp;treasury
bonds denominated in US$ for a term consistent with the expected term of the Company&rsquo;s options in effect at the option valuation
date. Expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not anticipate any dividend payments in the foreseeable future. The expected
exercise multiple was estimated as the average ratio of the stock price to the exercise price of when employees would decide to voluntarily
exercise their vested options. Expected term is the contract life of the option.</FONT></P>

the binomial option pricing model. The inputs used in the analysis were classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy

rules to the New EIT Law provide that non-resident legal entities are considered PRC residents if substantial and overall management

the present uncertainties resulting from the limited PRC tax guidance on the issue, the Company does not believe that the legal entities
organized outside the PRC should be treated as residents for 2008 EIT law purposes. If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine
that the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside the PRC are deemed resident enterprises, the Company and its subsidiaries registered
outside the PRC will be subject to the PRC income tax at a rate of&nbsp;25%.</FONT></P>

Company and its operations from time to time are, and in the future may be, parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations,
and proceedings, including but not limited to acts of non-compliance with respect to lease contracts, which are handled and defended
in the ordinary course of business. The Company may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or a range of reasonably possible
losses until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss,
such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings
by the court on motions or appeals, or the progress of settlement negotiations. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably
estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including
those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.</FONT></P>

Lim, the former Chief Executive Officer of Cook San Francisco LLC (&ldquo;Cook&rdquo;), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, has alleged
that she had Good Reason (as defined in her&nbsp;employment agreement) to resign from Cook and is thus owed severance by the Company
and Cook. Ms. Lim, in her capacity as Sellers&rsquo; Representative in the Membership Interests Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;MIPA&rdquo;)
between the Company and Cook members pursuant to which the Company purchased the interests in Cook, has also alleged that the Company
breached the MIPA relating to post-closing payments. On November&nbsp;26, 2024, Ms. Lim filed a complaint with the Superior Court State
of California, County of San Francisco, against the Company, Cook and our CEO, Norma Chu, as an individual, asserting breach of contract
and breach of various labor laws. The Company disputes the merits of Ms. Lim&rsquo;s claims but has been negotiating a settlement with
her to resolve all outstanding disputes. Failure to obtain a favorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s
business, results of operations and financial condition. Currently, the amount of such material adverse effect cannot be reasonably estimated,
and no provision or liability has been recorded for these claims as of December&nbsp;31, 2024.</FONT></P>

April&nbsp;1, 2025, Plaintiff Leland Copenhagen (&ldquo;Copenhagen&rdquo;) filed a civil action before the United&nbsp;States District
Court for the Southern District of New&nbsp;York alleging a single claim for breach of contract against DDC Enterprise Limited, DDC US
Inc., and Yai&rsquo;s Thai, Inc. arising from Copenhagen&rsquo;s termination of a written &ldquo;Employment Agreement&rdquo; with Yai&rsquo;s
Thai, Inc. Copenhagen seeks alleged damages of approximately US$235,000&nbsp;in allegedly unpaid wages, severance, and expense reimbursements.
The Company believes the claims are without merit and intend to move for the dismissal of the action and, should the case continue, defend
the action. Separately, on March&nbsp;14, 2025, Copenhagen, for himself and similarly-situated shareholders of Yai&rsquo;s Thai, Inc.,
sent DDC Enterprise Limited, DDC US Inc., and Norma Chu a letter demanding indemnification pursuant to a written &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;
arising from the alleged failure to properly fund working capital to Yai&rsquo;s Thai, Inc. and to release the Indemnity Holdback Cash
(as defined in the Merger Agreement). Copenhagen claims that the foregoing events prevented the shareholders from attaining their Maximum
Earnout Payments of US$2.1&nbsp;million. The Company believes the claims are without merit and intend to defend the action.</FONT></P>
