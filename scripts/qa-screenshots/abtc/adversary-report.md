## 🔴 CRITICAL FINDING: Wrong Share Count for mNAV

### The Problem

ABTC's `companies.ts` uses **899,489,426** as `sharesOutstanding`, but this number is **NOT the actual shares outstanding**. It is the **"Diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding"** from the EPS calculation table in the 10-Q.

### Evidence

**From 10-Q Cover Page (official shares outstanding):**
> "As of November 13, 2025, the registrant had **195,380,091** shares of Class A common stock, **732,224,903** shares of Class B common stock, and no shares of Class C common stock outstanding."

**Total actual shares:** 195,380,091 + 732,224,903 = **927,604,994**

**From 10-Q Income Statement EPS section:**
```
Weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding:
Basic:    899,354,931
Diluted:  899,489,426  ← ABTC is incorrectly using this!
```

### Impact

| Metric | Wrong (Current) | Correct | Difference |
|--------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| Shares | 899,489,426 | 927,604,994 | **28,115,568 shares** |
| Percentage | - | - | **3.1% error** |

For mNAV calculations, this undercounts shares by ~28 million, which **overstates** the per-share NAV and **understates** the mNAV multiple.

### Why This Matters

The "Diluted weighted average" is a mathematical construct for EPS calculations that:
1. Weights shares by the time period they were outstanding during the quarter
2. Includes dilutive securities (options, warrants) hypothetically exercised
3. Is NOT the actual count of shares that exist

The **cover page share count** is the official, audited number of shares actually outstanding at a specific date.

## 🛠️ Recommended Fix

Update `companies.ts` for ABTC:

```typescript
sharesOutstanding: 927_604_994,  // Cover page as of Nov 13, 2025 (Class A + Class B)
sharesSourceUrl: 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1755953/000119312525281390/abtc-20250930.htm',
sharesSourceNote: 'Cover page: 195,380,091 Class A + 732,224,903 Class B = 927,604,994 total',
```

---

## ⚠️ Note on Share Classes

ABTC has multiple share classes:
- **Class A:** 195,380,091 (publicly traded on NASDAQ)
- **Class B:** 732,224,903 (held by Hut 8 Corp parent)
- **Class C:** 0

For mNAV purposes, **all shares matter** because they all represent ownership claims on the company's Bitcoin. The Class B shares held by Hut 8 are still real shares that dilute the NAV per share.

If the intent was to only count **publicly traded shares** (Class A), then the number should be **195,380,091**, not 899 million.

Either way, **899,489,426 is wrong** — it's neither the total shares nor the Class A shares.
