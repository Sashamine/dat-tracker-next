## Quarterly History (for HPS chart verification)

| Quarter | Holdings (BTC) | Holdings Source | Shares | Shares Source |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|--------|---------------|
| Q3 2025 (Sep 30) | 3,418 BTC* | 10-Q Digital Assets footnote (to verify) | 920,684,912 | 10-Q Balance Sheet |
| Q4 2025 (Dec 14) | ~5,098 BTC | Press Release Dec 16, 2025 | TBD | Not yet disclosed |

*Note: The 3,418 BTC figure needs verification from the 10-Q digital assets footnote (Note 6) or XBRL data.

## Important Notes

1. **Share Structure:** ABTC has Class A, B, and C common stock. Only Class A trades on NASDAQ (ticker: ABTC). Class B is held by Hut 8 Corp. (parent company).

2. **For mNAV/sharesForMnav:** Need to determine if all share classes should be counted, or only public float (Class A).

3. **Digital Asset Accounting:** The balance sheet shows digital assets at fair value in USD. The actual BTC unit count appears in the notes/XBRL rather than the face of the balance sheet.

4. **BITMAIN Agreement:** A significant portion of digital assets are "pledged for miner purchase" under an agreement with BITMAIN - this creates the $286M miner purchase liability.
