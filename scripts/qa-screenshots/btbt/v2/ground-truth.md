## Step 9: Dilutive Instruments

### $150M Convertible Senior Notes (4.00% Due 2030)

**Source:** 8-K filed October 2, 2025 (Accession: 0001213900-25-095533)
**Source URL:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1710350/000121390025095533/ea0259669-8k_bitdigital.htm

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Principal Amount | $150,000,000 |
| Interest Rate | 4.00% per annum |
| Maturity Date | October 1, 2030 |
| Issue Date | October 2, 2025 |
| Conversion Rate | 240.3846 shares per $1,000 principal |
| **Conversion Price** | **~$4.16 per share** |
| Net Proceeds | $143.3 million |
| Use of Proceeds | Purchase Ethereum, general corporate purposes |
| Put Date | October 1, 2028 (holders can require repurchase) |
| Call Date | On/after October 6, 2028 (130% trigger) |

**Verbatim Quote:**
> "On September 29, 2025, Bit Digital, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement... in connection with the issuance and sale of $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030"

> "The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 240.3846 ordinary shares of the Company per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $4.16 per ordinary share."

**Potential Dilution:**
- At conversion: $150M × (240.3846 shares / $1,000) = **36,057,690 shares**
- ITM threshold: Stock price > $4.16

## Step 11: mNAV Calculation (Illustrative)

### Inputs (from most recent sources)
| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| ETH Holdings | 155,239.4 ETH | Feb 6, 2026 PR |
| ETH Price | $2,449 | Feb 6, 2026 PR |
| Shares Outstanding | 324,202,059 | Feb 6, 2026 PR |
| Cash | $179,118,182 | Q3 10-Q (Sep 30, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $150,000,000 | Convertible notes |
| Preferred Equity | $9,050,000 | Q3 10-Q |
| WYFI Stake Value | $527,600,000 | Feb 6, 2026 PR |

### Calculation
```
CryptoNAV = ETH × Price
         = 155,239.4 × $2,449
         = $380,191,311

EV = MarketCap + Debt + PreferredEquity - ExcessCash
   = (324,202,059 × $1.76*) + $150M + $9.05M - $0**
   = $570.6M + $150M + $9.05M
   = $729.65M

mNAV = EV / CryptoNAV
     = $729.65M / $380.2M
     = 1.92x

* Using current BTBT price ~$1.76 from website
** Cash treatment: Assume cash earmarked for operations/crypto, not excess
```

**Note:** Company's own mNAV presentation (from Feb 4, 2026 investor deck using Dec 31, 2025 data):
> "mNAV per Share $2.74"
> "BTBT Share Price $1.89"
> "-31% Discount"

This suggests company may be including WYFI stake in their NAV calculation as "Combined Asset Value."

## Data Quality Notes

1. **ETH Holdings Discrepancy:** Feb 4, 2026 investor presentation shows both 155,277.3 and 155,227.3 ETH (50 ETH difference between slides) — likely typo. Feb 6, 2026 PR shows 155,239.4 ETH as of Jan 31, 2026.

2. **Shares Outstanding:** Cover page (323,674,831 as of Nov 10, 2025) vs period-end (322,124,795 as of Sep 30, 2025) differ slightly. January 2026 PR shows 324,202,059. Use most recent (Jan 31, 2026) for current calculations.

3. **No XBRL CryptoAssetNumberOfUnits:** BTBT doesn't use this XBRL tag. ETH holdings must be extracted from PR/8-K disclosures.

4. **WYFI Consolidation:** Q3 10-Q shows Noncontrolling Interests of $139.4M, indicating WhiteFiber is consolidated. The 70.4% ownership is after WhiteFiber's IPO.

5. **Preferred Stock Treatment:** $9.05M preferred equity should be included in EV calculation.
