## Notes

1. **Tax Loss Harvesting:** The December 22 sale was specifically for generating capital losses to carry back against previous capital gains for tax benefit. This was MSTR's first-ever BTC sale.

2. **No October Activity:** There were no BTC purchases or sales during October 2022, hence the 130,000 BTC balance remained unchanged from Q3 end.

3. **Subsidiary Structure:** All Q4 2022 transactions were conducted through MacroStrategy LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary.

4. **Carrying Value vs Cost:** At December 31, 2022, MSTR carried $1.840 billion of digital assets on the balance sheet (after $2.153 billion in cumulative impairment losses).
