## Notes

1. **8-K 2021-11-03** (file: `8k-2021-11-03-318432.html`) is NOT a BTC purchase announcement - it covers CEO compensation changes (aircraft use policy, security program cap).

2. No October 2021 8-Ks were found for BTC purchases. The first Q4 announcement on Nov 29 covers the cumulative Q4 activity from Oct 1 - Nov 29.

3. All Q4 purchases were funded via the Jefferies At-The-Market (ATM) equity offering established June 14, 2021. The $1B ATM program was fully utilized by Dec 29, 2021.

4. The 1 BTC variance between calculated (124,392) and reported (124,391) is attributable to rounding in the "approximately" figures disclosed in 8-K filings.
