<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Brag House is a mission-driven organization that
utilizes a diversified business strategy to operate a vertically integrated platform designed for casual college gamers to drive community-driven
gaming experiences anchored in the college sports culture, while creating authentic pathways for brands to connect with our Gen Z audience.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Brag House is a Delaware corporation formed in
December&nbsp;2021. Our founders developed the idea for the Brag House platform in 2018, when our Chief Executive Officer Lavell Juan
Malloy,&nbsp;II and co-founder, Chief Operating Officer Daniel Leibovich recognized a need in the gaming industry for an esports platform
focused specifically on the casual college gamer, and formed our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, BHI.&nbsp;At that time, our co-founders
believed that a significant amount of industry resources were focused predominantly on competitive and professional gamers, much to the
detriment of casual gamers, generally, and casual college gamers, specifically. In the&nbsp;years ensuing, we have maintained our focus
on the casual college gaming segment and believe we are developing a first-of-its-kind digital platform for casual college gamers to
compete, support their team, banter in a safe environment and win prizes. Our vertically integrated approach combines gamer recruitment,
facilitation of community engagement and content creation, live-stream production and tournament host activities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"> We believe we are creating
a new sports entertainment medium for Gen Z to engage&nbsp;through gaming by merging gameplay with school spirit in Brag House and student-led
activations and tournaments tied to college rivalries with Brag House features and capabilities such as our Bragging Functionality, Loyalty
Tokens reward system, and brand-sponsored content and prizes.&nbsp;The growth of our platform since our inception is encouraging, and
we believe we are strongly positioned to capitalize on a large portion of the available gaming market. We experienced strong community
growth since we launched through June 30, 2025, reaching nearly 1,400,000 video views of our Brag House Content on video platforms including
X (formerly known as Twitter), TikTok, Meta, Twitch and YouTube, which represent a 107 % increase in views year-over-year from 2020 to
2025. We have also generated nearly 8.5&nbsp;million impressions and video views since inception, which represents approximately a 45
% increase year-over-year from 2020 to 2025. Additionally, since 2022, Brag House spectators who viewed live streams remained on the
platform for 19 minutes per live stream across over 290,000 live views, which represents nearly a 1.75X increase compared to the industry
benchmark of 11 minutes. This growth suggests that Brag House has the potential to become an important component of the infrastructure
for everyday gamers which, in turn, will lead to accretive synergies in the greater esports ecosystem. In addition, our digital properties,
including our mobile application and website, provide a level of scale which brings players and spectators together across the United&nbsp;States,
both digitally and physically. As the world works to return to a state of normalcy from the impact of COVID-19, we believe live experiences
will provide another source of connection to augment our digital experience. We believe this dynamic, coupled with our personalized experiential
framework, offers a uniquely authentic and differentiated channel for advertisers to utilize, making the otherwise elusive demographic
of Gen Z and Millennial gamers and streamers accessible at scale. </P>
<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We are focused on creating an organic and inclusive
community which facilitates personalized experiences. We believe our experiential framework offers a more authentic and differentiated
channel for advertisers to utilize, making the otherwise elusive demographic of gamers and streamers accessible at scale to ourselves
and our partners. We do this by offering brand sponsors and advertisers an exclusive marketing channel to reach elusive Gen Z and Millennial
gamers and creators, while offering players ways to access exclusive tournaments and programming.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"> In May 2025, we launched
the first activation under our strategic partnership with Learfield. This activation was for students at the University of Florida. We
believe this partnership gave us access to media rights and assets across nearly 200 universities, enabling physical and digital activations.
These activations will integrate sponsorship branding and messaging across our platform and universities&rsquo; assets with pricing and
value delivery defined through a structured commercial model. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In July 2025, we executed the second activation under our strategic partnership with Learfield, expanding on the success of our initial
May 2025 event. This activation was conducted virtually and designed to engage students and alumni through a digital tournament centered
around EA College Football 26, following the game&rsquo;s national release. The event incorporated university-branded content and featured
participation from student-athletes, further aligning with our Name, Image, and Likeness (&ldquo;NIL&rdquo;) engagement strategy. We
believe this activation demonstrated our ability to scale digital experiences across collegiate communities and reinforced our commercial
model for integrating sponsorship, branded content, and fan engagement at the intersection of gaming and college sports.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Additionally, we are advancing a data monetization
strategy. The goal is to develop a proprietary machine learning-based SaaS platform designed to offer anonymized predictive data insights
into Gen Z behavior for brand clients. Development began post-IPO, in March 2025, with a beta version expected in Q3 2026.</P>

such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $700.0 million

directors of BHL determined that it was in the best interests of BHL and its shareholders that an initial public offering in the United&nbsp;States

and listing on Nasdaq, in December&nbsp;2021, the Company was formed. On February&nbsp;8, 2022, the Company approved a reorganization,
in which the shareholders of BHL would exchange their ordinary shares and preference shares of BHL for a proportionate number of common
and preferred shares in the Company on a 21 to 1 basis (&ldquo;U.S.&nbsp;Reorganization&rdquo;). Immediately following the U.S.&nbsp;Reorganization,
BHL became the wholly-owned&nbsp;subsidiary of the Company, and BHI became the indirect wholly-owned&nbsp;subsidiary of the Company.</P>

limited revenues and may not produce significant revenues in the near term, or at all, which may harm our ability to obtain additional
financing and may require us to reduce or discontinue our operations. You must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks
and difficulties we will encounter as a company operating in a rapidly evolving industry. We may not be able to successfully address
these risks and difficulties, which could significantly harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"> We have incurred operating
losses to date and it is possible we may never generate a profit. Our financial statements included in our Annual Report have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.
If we are unable to raise sufficient capital as and when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be
materially and adversely affected, and we will need to significantly modify our operational plans to continue as a going concern. If
we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation
or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Our lack of cash resources
and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new
capital, enter into critical contractual relations with third parties and otherwise execute our development strategy. We incurred a net
loss of $2,772,890 and $1,991,124 for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $3,288,519 and $4,672,348 for the

for the six months ended June 30, 2025 included interest expense and amortization of debt discount of $337,928 and $100,781, respectively.
These specific expenses have not been incurred starting in Q2 2025 due to the conversion, at the closing of the IPO,&nbsp;of all of the
Original Issue Discount Convertible Promissory Notes outstanding prior to the IPO. While the Company may incur debt within the next 12&nbsp;months,
the Company does not expect interest expense and amortization of debt discount to be as high in 2025 as it was in 2023 and 2024. </P>

common stock, adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with
Nasdaq and the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws, adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms,

stock and preferred stock may enable our Board to issue shares to persons friendly to current management or to issue preferred stock
with terms that could render more difficult or discourage a third-party attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender
offer, proxy contest or otherwise, thereby protecting the continuity of our management. In addition, our Board has the discretion to
determine designations, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights,
redemption privileges and liquidation preferences of each series of preferred stock, all to the fullest extent permissible under the
DGCL and subject to any limitations set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation. The purpose of authorizing our Board to issue preferred
stock and to determine the rights and preferences applicable to such preferred stock is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder
vote on specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible financings,
acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or could discourage
a third-party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.</P>
