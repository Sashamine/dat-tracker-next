<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> We are subject to a number of prohibitions,
restrictions and potential delisting risks under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the &ldquo;HFCAA&rdquo;). Pursuant to
the HFCAA and related regulations, if we have filed an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) has determined that it is unable to inspect and investigate completely, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) will identify us as a &ldquo;Commission-identified Issuer,&rdquo; and the
trading of our securities on any U.S. national securities exchange, as well as any over-the-counter trading in the United States, will
be prohibited if we are identified as a Commission-identified Issuer for two consecutive years. On December 29, 2022, the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2023 (the &ldquo;CAA&rdquo;) was signed into law by President Biden. The CAA, among other things, reduced the number
of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA as it was originally passed from the original
three years to two, and thus, reduced the time before a Commission-identified Issuer&rsquo;s securities may be prohibited from trading
or delisted. In August 2022, the PCAOB, the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC signed a Statement of Protocol (the &ldquo;Statement
of Protocol&rdquo;), which establishes a specific and accountable framework for the PCAOB to conduct inspections and investigations of
PCAOB-governed accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure
complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong completely
in 2022. The PCAOB Board vacated its previous 2021 determinations that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered
public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. However, whether the PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily
conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainties
and depends on a number of factors out of our and our auditor&rsquo;s control. The PCAOB continues to demand complete access in mainland
China and Hong Kong moving forward and is making plans to resume regular inspections in early 2023 and beyond, as well as to continue
pursuing ongoing investigations and initiate new investigations as needed. The PCAOB has also indicated that it will act immediately
to consider the need to issue new determinations with the HFCAA if needed. Our auditor, MaloneBailey, LLP, is not among the PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms headquartered in China and Hong Kong that are subject to PCAOB&rsquo;s determination issued on December 16, 2021
of having been unable to inspect or investigate completely. However, we could still face the risk of delisting and cease of trading of
our securities from a stock exchange or an over-the-counter market in the United States under the HFCAA and the securities regulations
promulgated thereunder if the PCAOB determines in the future that it is unable to completely inspect or investigate our auditor which
has a presence in China. These China-related risks could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities,
or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value
of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. In particular, recent policy statements and regulatory actions by the
PRC government, such as those related to the cryptocurrency mining business, may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business,
accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign stock exchange, which may cause our Class A ordinary shares to be prohibited
from trading or to be delisted from Nasdaq or any other U.S. stock exchange. See &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D.
Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&rdquo; in our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December
31, 2024 filed with the SEC on April 11, 2025 (the &ldquo;2024 20-F&rdquo;). </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> We face various legal and operational risks
and uncertainties related to being based in and having significant operations in China. The PRC government has significant authority
to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on
U.S. or other foreign exchanges. For example, we face risks associated with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings and oversight
on cybersecurity and data privacy. The PRC government may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, or may exert control
over operations of our business, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our Class A ordinary shares.
See also &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;The PRC government has significant authority to
exert influence on the China operations of an offshore holding company, and offerings conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based
issuers, such as us. Changes in China&rsquo;s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the value of our securities.&rdquo; We may need to make material
changes in our operations to comply with those requirements and/or the value of our Class A ordinary shares might be affected. PRC government&rsquo;s
certain administrative requirements in regulating our operations, the overseas offering and listing of China-based issuers, and foreign
investments could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Class A ordinary shares and/or
other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. The PRC government also
has significant discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene with or influence our operations or the development of
the relevant industry as it deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals, subject to necessary procedures. Uncertainties
regarding the enforcement of laws and that the rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice. See &ldquo;Risk
Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;Uncertainties with respect to the enforcement of and changes in laws
and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future
prospects, and cause our Class A ordinary shares to significantly decline in value or become worthless,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks
Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;The PRC government has significant influence over companies with China-based operations
by enforcing existing rules and regulation, adopting new ones, or changing relevant industrial policies in a manner that may materially
increase our compliance cost, change relevant industry landscape or otherwise cause significant changes to our operations in China, which
could result in material and adverse changes in our operations and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.&rdquo;
Furthermore, the PRC government has recently exerted more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and foreign investment
in China-based companies, and these rules could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities
to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks
Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;Recent regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review
or otherwise restrict or completely hinder our ability to offer securities and raise capitals overseas, all of which could materially
and adversely affect our business and cause the value of our Class A ordinary shares to significantly decline or become worthless.&rdquo; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Investors in our Class A ordinary shares are
not purchasing equity securities of our subsidiaries that have substantive business operations in China but instead are purchasing equity
securities of a Cayman Islands holding company. Nano Labs Ltd is a holding company with no material operations of its own. We conduct
our operations primarily through our subsidiaries in China and one of our subsidiaries in Hong Kong. Such structure involves unique risks
to investors in our Class A ordinary shares. Investors may never directly hold equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries with substantive
operations. We also cannot assure you that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not disallow such a structure. If the Chinese regulatory
authorities disallow the structure, it would likely result in a material change in our operations and cause the value of our Class A
ordinary shares to significantly decline or become worthless. See &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related
to Our Corporate Structure and Governance&rdquo; in the 2024 20-F.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">In recent years, the PRC government initiated
a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business operations in China with little advance
notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed
overseas, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. The
PRC government also exerts more control over offerings conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers. In particular,
on February 17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the &ldquo;CSRC&rdquo;) released the Trial Administrative Measures
of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the &ldquo;Trial Measures&rdquo;), which came into effect on March
31, 2023. The Trial Measures apply to overseas securities offerings and/or listings conducted by (1) companies incorporated in the PRC,
or PRC domestic companies, directly and (2) companies incorporated overseas with operations primarily in the PRC and valued on the basis
of interests in PRC domestic companies, or indirect offerings. The Trial Measures requires (i) the filings of the overseas offering and
listing plan by the PRC domestic companies with the CSRC under certain conditions, and (ii) the filing of their underwriters or placement
agents with the CSRC under certain conditions and the submission of an annual report to the CSRC within the required timeline. On the
same day, the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by
Domestic Companies (the &ldquo;Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions&rdquo;) promulgated by the CSRC came into effect.
Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions stipulate that the PRC companies seeking overseas offerings and listings, either
directly or indirectly, as well as securities firms and securities service providers (both the PRC and overseas) involved in relevant
businesses, must not disclose any state secrets or confidential information of government agencies, nor harm national security and public
interests. Additionally, if a domestic company provides accounting archives or copies of such archives to any entities, including securities
firms, securities service providers, overseas regulators and individuals, it must comply with due procedures in accordance with applicable
regulations. We believe that offerings under this prospectus do not involve the disclosure of any state secret or confidential information
of government agencies, nor does it harm national security and public interests. However, we may need to perform additional procedures
concerning the provision of accounting archives. The specific requirements of these procedures are currently unclear, and we cannot guarantee
our ability to execute them. According to the Notice on the Administrative Arrangements for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering
and Listing by Domestic Enterprises (the &ldquo;Notice on Overseas Listing Measures&rdquo;) published by the CSRC on February 17, 2023,
issuers that had already been listed in an overseas market by March 31, 2023, the date the Trial Measures became effective, are not required
to make any immediate filing and are only required to comply with the filing requirements under the Trial Measures when it subsequently
seeks to conduct a follow-on offering. Therefore, we are required to go through filing procedures with the CSRC within three working
days after the completion of the Private Placement and for our future offerings of our securities in an overseas market, including Nasdaq,
under the Trial Measures. Other than the CSRC filing procedure we are required to make within three working days after the completion
of the Private Placement, we and our PRC subsidiaries, as advised our PRC legal counsel, Zhong Lun Law Firm, (1) are not required to
obtain permissions from the CSRC, and (2) have not been required to obtain or denied such and other permissions by the CSRC, CAC, or
any PRC government authority, under current PRC laws, regulations and rules in connection with the Private Placement or a potential resale
by the selling shareholders made pursuant to this prospectus. See &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related
to Conducting Business in China&mdash;Recent regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review or otherwise
restrict or completely hinder our ability to offer securities and raise capitals overseas, all of which could materially and adversely
affect our business and cause the value of our Class A ordinary shares to significantly decline or become worthless&rdquo; in the 2024

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The structure of cash flows within our organization,
and the applicable regulations, are as follows. After foreign investors&rsquo; funds enter Nano Labs Ltd, our holding company, subject
to the cash demand of our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries, the funds can be transferred to our wholly owned Cayman subsidiaries, then
to our wholly owned BVI subsidiaries, then to our Hong Kong subsidiaries, which will further distribute the funds to our PRC subsidiaries.
If we intend to distribute dividends, PRC subsidiaries will transfer the dividends to our Hong Kong subsidiaries in accordance with the
laws and regulations of the PRC, and then our Hong Kong subsidiaries will transfer the dividends all the way up to Nano Labs Ltd, and
the dividends will be distributed from Nano Labs Ltd to all shareholders respectively in proportion to the shares they hold, regardless
of whether the shareholders are U.S. investors or investors in other countries or regions. The cross-border transfer of funds within
our corporate group under our direct holding structure must be legal and compliant with relevant laws and regulations of China. In utilizing
the proceeds from the Private Placement, as an offshore holding company, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding
to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our affiliated entities only through loans, subject to applicable
government reporting, registration and approvals. See &ldquo;Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use
of Proceeds&mdash;Use of Proceeds&rdquo; and &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business
in China&mdash;PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control
of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of the securities offering to make loans or additional capital
contributions to our PRC subsidiaries&rdquo; in the 2024 20-F. In 2022, 2023 and 2024, we transferred cash proceeds of US$24.3 million,
US$17.5 million and US$13.1 million to our PRC subsidiaries for the settlement of intercompany transactions and as paid-in capital for
our PRC subsidiaries, and none of our PRC subsidiaries has issued any dividends or distributions to respective holding companies or any
investors as of the date of this prospectus. We do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares . We have,
from time to time, transferred cash between our PRC subsidiaries to fund their operations, and we do not anticipate any difficulties
or limitations on our ability to transfer cash between such subsidiaries. As of the date of this prospectus, no cash generated from our
PRC subsidiaries has been used to fund operations of any of our non-PRC subsidiaries. We may encounter difficulties in our ability to
transfer cash between PRC subsidiaries and non-PRC subsidiaries largely due to various PRC laws and regulations imposed on foreign exchange.
However, as long as we are compliant with the procedures for approvals from foreign exchange authorities and banks in China, the relevant
laws and regulations in China do not impose limitations on the amount of funds that we can transfer out of China. We currently do not
have any cash management policy that dictate the transfer of cash between our subsidiaries. See &ldquo;Item 4. Information of the Company&mdash;B.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We are a leading Web 3.0 infrastructure and
product solution provider, specialized in the development of HTC chips and HPC chips. We have built a comprehensive FPU architecture
which offers solution that integrates the features of both HTC and HPC. In addition, we have actively positioned ourselves in the digital
assets space, adopting BNB as our primary reserve asset. As of August 28, 2025, we have accumulated nearly US$178 million in mainstream
digital currencies including BNB and BTC.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> We plan to further strengthen our BNB strategic
reserve through multiple approaches, including continued accumulation of BNB, acquisition of controlling stakes in BNB-focused strategic
reserve entities, and investment in companies dedicated to holding BNB as a core reserve asset. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We have established an integrated solution platform
covering two main&nbsp;business verticals, including HTC solutions and HPC solutions. Our HTC solutions feature our proprietary&nbsp;Cuckoo&nbsp;series
chips, which have become alternative ASICs solutions for traditional GPUs. Our HPC solutions offer both HPC chips,&nbsp;Darkbird, and
Bitcoin mining machine,&nbsp;iPollo. In addition to HTC and HPC chips, we launched our&nbsp;Darksteel&nbsp;series, which can be applied
to both industrial and commercial sectors by offering distributed computing and data storage solutions, in the fourth quarter of 2021.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> BNB functions as the core utility and governance
token within the BNB chain ecosystem (BNB Chain), supporting diversified use cases primarily including decentralized finance (DeFi),
centralized finance (CeFi), and payment solutions (PayFi). BNB operates as a multifunctional, scalable blockchain infrastructure token
essential to BNB Chain&rsquo;s ecosystem operations and innovation. BNB may be utilized to enable transaction fee payments, staking/governance
participation, liquid staking derivatives, CeFi privileges, real-world payments, decentralized storage, and financial services, while
supporting ecosystem growth through validator rewards and protocol governance. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> <I>BNB Token Supply Mechanisms</I> </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> <I>&nbsp;</I> </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> BNB was launched in 2017 with an initial total
supply of 200 million tokens. The protocol operates a deflationary model that progressively reduces supply. As of July 2025 following
the 32<SUP>nd</SUP> quarterly burn event, BNB&rsquo;s total supply stood at approximately 139.29 million tokens. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> &nbsp; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> For the token generation mechanism, BNB implements
zero post-launch token minting, eliminating inflationary mechanisms. Supply reduction occurs exclusively through burning. Cross-chain
transfers between BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and BNB Greenfield utilize lock/unlock protocols, and there is no new token creation for BNB. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> &nbsp; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> For the burn mechanism, BNB employs two primary
burn mechanisms, including (1) auto-burn, which executes algorithmic quarterly burns based on BNB market price and BSC block production
metrics, which constitutes an auditable, transparent on-chain process independent of centralized exchanges, and (2) real-time burn, which
destroys a portion of BSC gas fees per block where governance mechanisms determine the burn ratio, dynamically adjusting according to
network activity. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> &nbsp; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> In addition, BNB operates as a deflationary
token. The auto-burn and real-time burn mechanisms systematically reduce total supply. There is no inflation mechanism for BNB, as it
prohibits new token creation. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"> &nbsp; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> The BNB ecosystem comprises multiple blockchains,
including BSC, opBNB (Layer-2 scaling solution), and BNB Greenfield (decentralized storage network), collectively establishing infrastructure
supporting Web3, DeFi, AI, and data tokenization innovations. BNB serves as the core utility token enabling payment fees, staking, governance,
storage, and real-world transactions across this ecosystem. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> BNB commenced its lifecycle with a genesis
event in 2017, launching via an initial coin offering where 200 million tokens were minted. It initially existed as an Ethereum ERC-20
token before migrating to become the native token of BNB Chain. The protocol explicitly prohibits the creation of any new tokens after
this genesis event. </P>

a careful evaluation of their security measures, regulatory compliance, and requires approval by our senior management. When establishing
new wallets, an operational representative and two additional reviewers are required to be physically present. Wallet passwords are set
and securely maintained by one designated reviewer. We employ a robust &ldquo;3-of-2&rdquo; multi-signature security arrangement to enhance
protection, requiring multiple authorized signatures to authorize transactions. Hardware wallets are securely stored in dedicated safes.
Software wallets are utilized strictly as transitional platforms, facilitating individual incoming and outgoing transactions without
retaining balances, thereby minimizing exposure and enhancing security. Our auditor performs annual procedures in compliance with PCAOB
rules, including existence verification, to reasonably assure the balance of our cryptocurrency assets reported in the consolidated balance

holdings stored by the CEFFU are completely segregated and verifiable on-chain. CEFFU has SOC II Type II audits from its auditor to ensure
the security of our cryptocurrency assets. Specifically, CEFFU utilizes multi-party computation technology to eliminate single points
of private key vulnerability. By distributing key shares across FIPS 140-2 compliant hardware security modules with strict non-exportability
controls, this cryptographic architecture ensures end-to-end protection against key compromise. However, CEFFU does not provide insurance
on client assets under custody. Instead, CEFFU maintains its own internal risk management and asset allocation policies. See &ldquo;Risk

by Binance, which is an online exchange and a trading platform for digital assets trading. Binance does not make custodian arrangements
publicly available according to its internal policy. As a result, we lack visibility into the custody arrangements, including how the
private key is stored, and whether Binance maintains insurance coverage for our holdings. We have a standard agreement with Binance which
stipulates, among others, that our cryptocurrency assets held by Binance are not segregated on-chain in different wallets from cryptocurrency
assets held on behalf of other users. According to the standard agreement, Binance uses an internal ledger to record customer entitlements
to the quantity and type of digital assets. Each user will have an account which is a ledger-based, or off-chain, account within the
Binance system with a unique identifier and associated login credentials, against which the relevant user credit balances are recorded.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severe and Lawful Crackdown on Illegal Securities
Activities, which was available to the public on July 6, 2021. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over
illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies. These opinions proposed to take effective
measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents facing China-based overseas-listed
companies and the demand for cybersecurity and data privacy protection. Moreover, on January 4, 2022, the CAC, and other ministries and
commissions (including the CSRC), announced the adoption of the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective on February 15,
2022 and provides that network platform operators possessing personal information of more than one million individual users must undergo
a cybersecurity review by the CAC when they seek to have their securities listed on a foreign stock exchange. Furthermore, the Standing
Committee of the National People&rsquo;s Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law of the PRC(&ldquo;PIPL&rdquo;), which
became effective on November 1, 2021, requires such operators to obtain consent of the user prior to any cross-border transfer of personal
information, as well as the satisfaction of at least one of the following conditions: (1) a security assessment organized by competent
cybersecurity authorities has been passed; (2) certification of personal information protection from a specialized institution in accordance
with the provisions issued by competent cybersecurity authorities has been passed; (3) a model standard contract about both parties&rsquo;
rights and obligations formulated by competent cybersecurity authorities with the overseas recipient has been entered into; or (4) any
other condition prescribed by laws, administrative regulations or by competent cybersecurity authorities has been satisfied. These policies
and any related implementation rules to be enacted may subject us to additional compliance requirement. As of the date of this prospectus,
no official guidance or related implementation rules have been issued in relation to these issued opinions, and the interpretation and
implementation of these opinions remain unclear at this stage. Moreover, the M&amp;A Rules requires an overseas special purpose vehicle
that are controlled by PRC companies or individuals formed for the purpose of seeking a public listing on an overseas stock exchange through
acquisitions of PRC domestic companies using shares of such special purpose vehicle or held by its shareholders as considerations to obtain
the approval of the CSRC, prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle&rsquo;s securities on an overseas stock exchange.
However, the application of the M&amp;A Rules remains unclear.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">In recent years, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory
actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business operations in China with little advance notice, including
cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas, adopting
new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. The PRC government also
exerts more control over offerings conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers. In particular, on February 17, 2023,
the CSRC released the Trial Measures, which came into effect on March 31, 2023. The Trial Measures apply to overseas securities offerings
and/or listings conducted by (1) companies incorporated in the PRC, or PRC domestic companies, directly and (2) companies incorporated
overseas with operations primarily in the PRC and valued on the basis of interests in PRC domestic companies, or indirect offerings. The
Trial Measures requires (i) the filings of the overseas offering and listing plan by the PRC domestic companies with the CSRC under certain
conditions, and (ii) the filing of their underwriters or placement agents with the CSRC under certain conditions and the submission of
an annual report to the CSRC within the required timeline. On the same day, the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives
Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the &ldquo;Confidentiality and Archives Administration
Provisions&rdquo;) promulgated by the CSRC came into effect. Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions stipulate that the
PRC companies seeking overseas offerings and listings, either directly or indirectly, as well as securities firms and securities service
providers (both the PRC and overseas) involved in relevant businesses, must not disclose any state secrets or confidential information
of government agencies, nor harm national security and public interests. Additionally, if a domestic company provides accounting archives
or copies of such archives to any entities, including securities firms, securities service providers, overseas regulators and individuals,
it must comply with due procedures in accordance with applicable regulations. We believe that offerings under this prospectus do not involve
the disclosure of any state secret or confidential information of government agencies, nor does it harm national security and public interests.
However, we may need to perform additional procedures concerning the provision of accounting archives. The specific requirements of these
procedures are currently unclear, and we cannot guarantee our ability to execute them. According to the Notice on Overseas Listing Measures
published by the CSRC on February 17, 2023, issuers that had already been listed in an overseas market by March 31, 2023, the date the
Trial Measures became effective, are not required to make any immediate filing and are only required to comply with the filing requirements
under the Trial Measures when it subsequently seeks to conduct a follow-on offering. Therefore, we are required to go through filing procedures
with the CSRC within three working days after the completion of the Private Placement and for our future offerings of our securities in
an overseas market, including Nasdaq, under the Trial Measures. Other than the CSRC filing procedure we are required to make within three
working days after the completion of the Private Placement, we and our PRC subsidiaries, as advised our PRC legal counsel, Zhong Lun Law
Firm, (1) are not required to obtain permissions from the CSRC, and (2) have not been required to obtain or denied such and other permissions
by the CSRC, CAC, or any PRC government authority, under current PRC laws, regulations and rules in connection with the Private Placement
or a potential resale made by the selling shareholders pursuant to this prospectus as of the date of this prospectus. See &ldquo;Item

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Nano Labs Ltd is a holding company with no material
operations of its own. We conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong. As a result, Nano Labs Ltd&rsquo;s
ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong. If our existing PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries
or any newly formed ones incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability
to pay dividends to us. We face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties related to being based in and having significant
operations in China. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as
us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on U.S. or other foreign exchanges. For example, we face risks associated
with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings and oversight on cybersecurity and data privacy. The PRC government may intervene in
or influence our operations at any time, or may exert control over operations of our business, which could result in a material change
in our operations and/or the value of our Class A ordinary shares. See also &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks
Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the China operations
of an offshore holding company, and offerings conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers, such as us. Changes in
China&rsquo;s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition, and the value of our securities&rdquo; in the 2024 20-F. We may need to make material changes in
our operations to comply with those requirements and/or the value of our Class A ordinary shares might be affected. PRC government&rsquo;s
certain administrative requirements in regulating our operations, the overseas offering and listing of China-based issuers, and foreign
investments could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Class A ordinary shares and/or
other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. The PRC government also
has significant discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene with or influence our operations or the development of
the relevant industry as it deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals, subject to necessary procedures. Uncertainties
regarding the enforcement of laws and that the rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice. See also
&ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;Uncertainties with respect

financial condition and future prospects, and cause our Class A ordinary shares to significantly decline in value or become worthless&rdquo;
in the 2024 20-F. Furthermore, the PRC government has recently exerted more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings
and foreign investment in China-based companies, and these rules could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer
or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become
worthless. For further details, see &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in

or distributions to respective holding companies or any investors as of the date of this prospectus. Our PRC subsidiaries generate and
retain cash generated from operating activities and re-invest it in our business. Historically, our PRC subsidiaries have also received
equity financing from its shareholders to fund business operations of our PRC subsidiaries. In 2022, 2023 and 2024, we transferred cash
proceeds of US$24.3 million, US$17.5 million and US$13.1 million to our PRC subsidiaries for the settlement of intercompany transactions
and as paid-in capital for our PRC subsidiaries. In the future, cash proceeds raised from overseas financing activities may be, and are
intended to be, transferred by us through subsidiaries in Hong Kong to our PRC subsidiaries via capital contribution and shareholder
loans, as the case may be. Subsidiaries in China that receives such cash proceeds then will transfer funds to its subsidiaries to meet
the capital needs of our business operations. For details about the applicable PRC rules that limit transfer of funds from overseas to
our PRC subsidiaries, see &ldquo;Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds&mdash;Use of Proceeds&rdquo;

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The structure of cash flows within our organization,
and the applicable regulations, are as follows. After foreign investors&rsquo; funds enter Nano Labs Ltd, our holding company, subject
to the cash demand of our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries, the funds can be transferred to our wholly owned Cayman subsidiaries, then
to our wholly owned BVI subsidiaries, then to our Hong Kong subsidiaries, which will further distribute the funds to our PRC subsidiaries.
If we intend to distribute dividends, PRC subsidiaries will transfer the dividends to our Hong Kong subsidiaries in accordance with the
laws and regulations of the PRC, and then our Hong Kong subsidiaries will transfer the dividends all the way up to Nano Labs Ltd, and
the dividends will be distributed from Nano Labs Ltd to all shareholders respectively in proportion to the shares they hold, regardless
of whether the shareholders are U.S. investors or investors in other countries or regions. The cross-border transfer of funds within
our corporate group under our direct holding structure must be legal and compliant with relevant laws and regulations of China. In utilizing
the proceeds from the Private Placement, as an offshore holding company, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding
to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our affiliated entities only through loans, subject to applicable
government reporting, registration and approvals. See &ldquo;Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use
of Proceeds&mdash;Use of Proceeds&rdquo; and &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business
in China&mdash;PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control

our PRC subsidiaries, and none of our PRC subsidiaries has issued any dividends or distributions to respective holding companies or any
investors as of the date of this prospectus. We do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares. We have,
from time to time, transferred cash between our PRC subsidiaries to fund their operations, and we do not anticipate any difficulties
or limitations on our ability to transfer cash between such subsidiaries. As of the date of this prospectus, no cash generated from our
PRC subsidiaries has been used to fund operations of any of our non-PRC subsidiaries. We may encounter difficulties in our ability to
transfer cash between PRC subsidiaries and non-PRC subsidiaries largely due to various PRC laws and regulations imposed on foreign exchange.
However, as long as we are compliant with the procedures for approvals from foreign exchange authorities and banks in China, the relevant
laws and regulations in China do not impose limitations on the amount of funds that we can transfer out of China. We currently do not
have any cash management policy that dictate the transfer of cash between our subsidiaries. See &ldquo;Item 4. Information of the Company&mdash;B.

in revenue for the last fiscal year, we qualify as an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups

applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Under the JOBS Act, an emerging
growth company does not need to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards until the date that private companies are
required to do so. We have elected to take advantage of such exemption, and as a result, while we are an emerging growth company, we
will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time that they become applicable to other public companies that

material losses and adversely affect our financial position.</I></B> </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> In 2024, we formally adopted BTC as our primary
reserve asset. During the second quarter of 2025, our management conducted a comprehensive review of prevailing market models for digital
currency reserve programs. Following rigorous internal evaluation, our management determined that BNB exhibited had shown considerable
market potential, and accordingly, we strategically reallocated our digital currency reserve to focus exclusively on BNB. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> &nbsp; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> We hold BNB as a reserve asset and intend to
acquire additional BNB, exposing us to extreme price fluctuations inherent in digital assets. The market value of BNB may experience
rapid, severe, and unpredictable declines due to factors including regulatory actions, market sentiment, technological changes, macroeconomic
conditions, or liquidity constraints. A material decline in BNB&rsquo;s value could substantially reduce the value of our reserve assets,
adversely affecting our liquidity, financial position, and results of operations. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt"> &nbsp; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> <B><I>BNB&rsquo;s value and utility are heavily dependent on the
ongoing operation, success, and reputation of Binance and its affiliates, exposing our reserves to material devaluation.</I></B> </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> BNB derives significant value from its association
with and utility across platforms operated by Binance. Adverse developments affecting Binance, including regulatory sanctions, legal
proceedings, operational failures, financial instability, reputational damage, loss of market share, or a decline in the adoption of
Binance-related services, could rapidly erode confidence in and demand for BNB, causing its market price to decline substantially and
materially harming the value of our holdings. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt"> &nbsp; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> As the issuer and primary governing authority
of BNB, Binance exerts centralized control over critical token attributes including burn mechanisms, distribution protocols, utility
features, staking rewards, and technological infrastructure. Binance may implement changes without our consent that reduce token scarcity,
diminish utility, alter fee structures, or disadvantage holders. Such actions could materially erode BNB&rsquo;s market value and directly
impair our reserve assets. Furthermore, adverse developments affecting Binance&rsquo;s financial stability, regulatory, reputation, or
operational integrity may severely undermine market confidence in BNB, triggering price declines that disproportionately impact our concentrated
holdings. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> Our reserve asset strategy concentrates significant
value in BNB. This concentration amplifies our exposure to BNB-specific risks, including technological obsolescence, competition from
other digital assets, reputational damage to Binance or the BNB ecosystem, protocol failures, or governance disputes. Failure of BNB
to maintain its functionality, market position, or value will disproportionately and adversely affect the value of our reserves compared
to a more diversified portfolio. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt"> &nbsp; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> BNB faces intense competition and rapid technological
change. Numerous other blockchain platforms, tokens, and cryptocurrencies compete with BNB Chain and BNB for users, developers, and market
share. The emergence of superior technology, more popular platforms, or changes in developer or user preferences could render BNB or
the BNB Chain ecosystem less competitive or obsolete, materially reducing demand for and the value of our BNB holdings. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt"> &nbsp; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"> <B><I>Our BNB holdings may face unique liquidity challenges or
devaluation due to concentration or market perception. Liquidity constraints may prevent us from converting BNB holdings into fiat currency
or stable value when needed, or without significant losses.</I></B> </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> As a significant holder of BNB, our attempts
to sell large quantities could materially exceed market depth at desired prices, especially during periods of stress, forcing us to accept
significant discounts. Furthermore, market perception of our holdings as a potential overhang or association with Binance-related risks
could independently exert downward pressure on BNB&rsquo;s price, adversely affecting the value of our entire reserve position. </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt"> &nbsp; </P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"> Our ability to convert BNB holdings into liquid
assets may be constrained. BNB markets may lack sufficient depth to execute large transactions without significantly impacting its price.
Exchange failures, trading suspensions, withdrawal restrictions, or operational disruptions at major trading platforms could impede our
ability to liquidate BNB promptly or at desired prices. Inability to access or liquidate our BNB reserves at necessary times, or only
at distressed prices, may materially impair our treasury management and ability to fund operations. </P>

arrangements publicly available according to its internal policy. As a result, we lack visibility into the custody arrangements, including
how the private key is stored, and whether Binance maintains insurance coverage for our holdings. We are unable to confirm whether Binance
maintains adequate controls to protect our assets against theft, cyberattacks, internal misconduct, technical failures, or insolvency.
According to our standard agreement with Binance, Binance is not a trustee of, and does not owe any trustee duties in relation to, any
cryptocurrency assets held to our credit.</P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin: 0pt 0; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif">The absence of insurance coverage exposes
us to substantial risk. The cryptocurrency industry experiences significant threats, including cyberattacks, hacking, phishing, fraudulent

exchange may experience operational failures, become insolvent, or simply refuse to return assets based on their terms of service. We
may bear the entire loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our inability to recover these cryptocurrency assets could also severely damage investor confidence and the market price of our securities.</P>

and may in the future release new regulations or policies that could intervene in or influence our operations or the industry sectors
in which we operate. The PRC government may also require us to obtain new permits or approvals to continue our operations. If we fail

have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to
evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal
systems. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into and could materially and adversely
affect our business and results of operations. </P>

fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with business operations located mainly in China that have listed their securities

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">Any of these factors
may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will trade. The securities of
some China-based&nbsp;companies that have listed their securities in the United&nbsp;States have experienced significant volatility since
their initial public offerings in recent&nbsp;years, including, in some cases, substantial declines in the trading prices of their securities.
The trading performances of these companies&rsquo; securities after their offerings may affect the attitudes of investors towards Chinese
companies listed in the United&nbsp;States in general, which consequently may impact the trading performance of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, any negative news or perceptions about inadequate corporate governance
practices or fraudulent accounting, corporate structure or other matters of other Chinese companies may also negatively affect the attitudes
of investors towards Chinese companies in general, including us, regardless of whether we have engaged in any inappropriate activities.
In particular, the global financial crisis, the ensuing economic recessions and deterioration in the credit market in many countries
have contributed and may continue to contribute to extreme volatility in the global stock markets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">Moreover, there have
been recent instances of extreme stock price run-ups&nbsp;followed by rapid price declines and strong stock price volatility with a number
of recent initial public offerings, particularly among companies with relatively smaller public floats. As we have a relatively small
public float, we may experience greater stock price volatility, including aggressive price run-ups&nbsp;and declines, lower trading volume
and less liquidity, compared with companies with larger public floats. In particular, our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares may be subject
to rapid and substantial price volatility, low volumes of trades and large spreads in bid and ask prices. Such volatility, including
any stock run-up, may be unrelated to our actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or prospects, and industry, market
or economic factors, which makes it difficult for prospective investors to assess such rapidly changing value of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares. In addition, if the trading volumes of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares are low, persons buying or selling in relatively small
quantities may easily influence prices of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. This low volume of trades could also cause the price of our
Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to fluctuate significantly, with large percentage changes in price occurring in any&nbsp;trading day session.
Holders of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares may also not be able to readily liquidate their investment or may be forced to sell at depressed
prices due to such low-volume&nbsp;trading. As a result of such volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our
Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. Such volatility also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares
or other securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, as well as our ability to retain key employees, many
of whom have been granted equity incentives. Furthermore, the potential extreme volatility may confuse the public investors of the value
of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, distort the market perception of the price of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, and our financial
performance and public image, and negatively affect the long-term&nbsp;liquidity of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, regardless of our
actual or expected operating performance.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">In the past, shareholders
of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against companies following periods of instability in the market
price of their securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management&rsquo;s
attention and other resources from our business and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit, which could harm our
results of operations. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise
capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.</P>

of US$59.52 million from the exercise of the Warrants if all of the Warrants are exercised for cash. We expect to use the net proceeds
from the exercise of Warrants for general corporate purposes. There is no assurance that the holders of the Warrants will elect to exercise
any or all of such Warrants or that they will exercise any or all of them for cash. The likelihood that warrant holders will exercise
the Warrants and any cash proceeds that we would receive is dependent upon the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. Based on
the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares at US$5.68 on August 28, 2025, which is less than the exercise price of $10.00 per share
pursuant to the terms of the Warrants, we believe holders of the Warrants will be unlikely to exercise their Warrants, and we are unlikely
to receive proceeds from the exercise of Warrants. The amount of cash we would receive from the exercise of the Warrants will decrease
to the extent that Warrants are exercised on a cashless basis.</P>

    <TD STYLE="vertical-align: top">As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company
    is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he owes the following duties to
    the company: a duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a personal profit based on his
    position as director (unless the company permits him to do so), a duty not to put himself in a position where the interests of the
    company conflict with his personal interest or his duty to a third party and a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for which
    such powers were intended. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously
    considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected
    from a person of his knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard
    with regard to the required skill and care <FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.</FONT></TD>

    has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty.
    The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under
    similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information
    reasonably available regarding a significant transaction.</P>

    he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He or she must not use his corporate position for personal
    gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its
    shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally.</P></TD></TR>

levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature
of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islands
except for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or after execution brought within the jurisdiction of the
Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties applicable to payments to or by our company. There are no

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">Under the EIT Law and
its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of China with a &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; within China is considered
a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The implementation rules
define the term &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; as the body that exercises full and substantial control over and overall management
of the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April&nbsp;2009, SAT issued Circular Regarding
the Determination of Chinese-Controlled&nbsp;Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprise on the Basis of De Facto
Management Bodies, or SAT Circular&nbsp;82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the &ldquo;de facto management
body&rdquo; of a PRC-controlled&nbsp;enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although SAT Circular 82 only applies
to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners,
the criteria set forth in SAT Circular 82 may reflect the general position of SAT on how the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; test
should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to SAT Circular&nbsp;82, an offshore
incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of
having its &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; in China only if all of the following conditions are met: (1)&nbsp;the primary location
of the&nbsp;day-to-day&nbsp;operational management is in China; (2)&nbsp;decisions relating to the enterprise&rsquo;s financial and human
resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in China; (3)&nbsp;the enterprise&rsquo;s primary
assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in China; and (4)&nbsp;at
least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in China.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">We do not believe that
our Cayman Islands holding company meets all of the conditions above. Our Cayman Islands holding company is not a PRC resident enterprise
for PRC tax purposes. As a holding company, its key assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries, and its key assets are located,
and its records (including the resolutions of its board of directors and the resolutions of its shareholders) are maintained, outside
China. For the same reasons, we believe our other entities outside of China are not PRC resident enterprises either. However, the tax
resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the
interpretation of the term &ldquo;de facto management body.&rdquo; There can be no assurance that the PRC government will ultimately
take a view that is consistent with ours.</P>

our legal counsel as to PRC law, has advised us that if the PRC tax authorities determine that our Cayman Islands holding company is
a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we may be required to withhold a 10% withholding tax from dividends we
pay to our shareholders that are non-resident&nbsp;enterprises with no institutions or premises established in the PRC or income bearing
no de facto relationship with the institution or premises established. In addition, non-resident&nbsp;enterprise shareholders may be
subject to a 10% PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced
from within China. It is unclear whether our non-PRC&nbsp;individual shareholders would be subject to any PRC tax on dividends or gains
obtained by such non-PRC&nbsp;individual shareholders in the event we are determined to be a PRC resident enterprise. If any PRC tax
were to apply to such dividends or gains, it would generally apply at a rate of 20% unless a reduced rate is available under an applicable
tax treaty. However, it is also unclear whether non-PRC&nbsp;shareholders of our Cayman Islands holding company would be able to claim
the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and China in the event that our Cayman Islands holding company
is treated as a PRC resident enterprise.</P>

Islands holding company is not deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, holders of the ordinary shares who are not PRC residents will
not be subject to PRC income tax on dividends distributed by us or gains realized from the sale or other disposition of our shares. However,
where a non-resident&nbsp;enterprise conducts an &ldquo;indirect transfer&rdquo; by transferring taxable assets, including, in particular,
equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise, indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident&nbsp;enterprise,
being the transferor, or the transferee or the PRC entity which directly owned such taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority
such indirect transfer. Using a &ldquo;substance over form&rdquo; principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the
overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring
PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee obligated
to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. We and
our non-PRC&nbsp;resident investors may be at risk of being required to file a return and being taxed under SAT Circular&nbsp;7, and
we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Circular&nbsp;7, or to establish that we should not be taxed thereunder.
See &ldquo;Risk Factors&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Risks Relating to Conducting Business in China&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;We may be subject to enterprise
income tax on our worldwide income if our company or any of our subsidiaries were considered a PRC &lsquo;resident enterprise&rsquo;

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">A non-United&nbsp;States
corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a &ldquo;passive foreign investment company,&rdquo; or a PFIC, for United&nbsp;States
federal income tax purposes, if, in the case of any particular taxable year, either (1)&nbsp;75% or more of its gross income for such
year consists of certain types of &ldquo;passive&rdquo; income or (2)&nbsp;50% or more of its average quarterly assets during such year
is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, cash is categorized as a passive
asset and the company&rsquo;s unbooked intangibles associated with active business activities may generally be classified as active assets.
For purposes of the income test, &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; generally consists of sales revenues less the cost of goods sold, together
with income from investments and from other sources, and &ldquo;passive income&rdquo; generally includes, among other things, dividends,
interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the disposition of passive assets. We will be treated as owning our proportionate share of
the assets and earning our proportionate share of the income of any other non-United&nbsp;States corporation in which we own, directly
or indirectly, more than 25% (by value) of the stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">Based upon our historical
income and assets and the value of our Class A ordinary shares, we do not believe we were a PFIC for the taxable

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">While we reasonably
do not expect to become a PFIC in the current or future taxable&nbsp;years, the determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC
will depend upon (i)&nbsp;the composition and characterization of our income (which may differ from our historical results and current
projections) and (ii)&nbsp;the composition and characterization of our assets and the value of our assets from time to time, including,
in particular the value of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles (which may depend upon the market value of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares from time-to-time&nbsp;and which has been and may continue to be volatile). In estimating the value of our goodwill and other
unbooked intangibles, we have taken into account our market capitalization, which has fluctuated significantly. Among other matters, if our market capitalization does not increase or continues to decline,
we may be or become classified as a PFIC for the current or future taxable&nbsp;years. It is also possible that the IRS may challenge
our classification of assets or income or the valuation of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, which may result in our company
being, or becoming classified as, a PFIC for the current or one or more future taxable&nbsp;years.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in; background-color: white">The determination of
whether we would be or become a PFIC may also depend, in part, on how, and how quickly, we used our liquid assets. Under circumstances
where we retain significant amounts of liquid assets, including cash, our risk of being classified as a PFIC may substantially increase.
Because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules and PFIC status is a factual determination made annually after
the close of each taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for the current taxable year ending December&nbsp;31,
2025 or any future taxable year. If we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S.&nbsp;Holder holds our Class&nbsp;A
ordinary shares, we generally would continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding&nbsp;years during which such U.S.&nbsp;Holder
holds our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares.</P>

be includible in the gross income of a U.S.&nbsp;Holder as dividend income on the&nbsp;day actually or constructively received by the
U.S.&nbsp;Holder of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of
United&nbsp;States federal income tax principles, any distribution will generally be treated as a &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; for United&nbsp;States
federal income tax purposes. Under current law, a non-corporate&nbsp;recipient of dividend income will generally be subject to tax on
dividend income from a &ldquo;qualified foreign corporation&rdquo; at the lower applicable net capital gains rate rather than the marginal
tax rates generally applicable to ordinary income, provided that certain holding period and other requirements are met.</P>

an exchange of information program, or (2)&nbsp;with respect to any dividend it pays on stock which is readily tradable on an established

tradeable on an established securities market in the United States because they are listed on Nasdaq. However, there
can be no assurance that our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will continue to be considered readily tradable on an established securities
market in later&nbsp;years. In the event we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the Enterprise Income Tax Law (see &ldquo;&mdash;&nbsp;PRC

dividends paid on our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. U.S.&nbsp;Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability
of the reduced tax rate on dividends in their particular circumstances. Dividends received on our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will not
be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to qualifying corporations under the Code.</P>

A U.S.&nbsp;Holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any foreign
withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. A U.S.&nbsp;Holder who does not elect to claim a
foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld may instead claim a deduction for United&nbsp;States federal income tax purposes in respect
of such withholding, but only for a year in which such holder elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes. The rules governing
the foreign tax&nbsp;credit are complex. U.S.&nbsp;Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Zhong Lun Law Firm has further advised us that
the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and
enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Zhong Lun Law Firm has advised us further
that under PRC law, a foreign judgment that does not otherwise violate the basic legal principles, national sovereignty, security or
public interest may be recognized and enforced by a PRC court, based either on bilateral treaties or international conventions contracted
by China and the jurisdiction where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any
treaties or other form of reciprocity with the United States or the Cayman Islands that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of foreign judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in China will not enforce a foreign judgment against
us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security
or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in
the United States or in the Cayman Islands. Under the PRC Civil Procedures Law, foreign shareholders may originate actions based on PRC
law against us in China if they can establish sufficient connection to China for a PRC court to have jurisdiction, and meet other procedural
requirements, including, among others, the plaintiff must have a direct interest in the case, and there must be a concrete claim, a factual
basis and a cause for the suit. However, it will be difficult for foreign shareholders, by virtue only of holding our Class A ordinary
shares or ordinary shares, to establish a sufficient connection to China for a PRC court to have jurisdiction as required under the PRC
Civil Procedures Law.</P>
