Agreement&rdquo;) with Maxim Group LLC (&ldquo;Maxim&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Sales Agent&rdquo;), dated August 21, 2025, relating to the
sale of shares of our Class A ordinary shares, par value US$0.002 per share, offered by this prospectus supplement. In accordance with
the terms of the Sales Agreement, under this prospectus supplement, we may offer and sell shares of our Class A ordinary shares having
an aggregate offering price of up to US$45,000,000 from time to time through Maxim, acting as our sales agent.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Sales of our Class A ordinary shares, if any,
under this prospectus supplement may be made at market prices by any method permitted by law that are deemed an &ldquo;at the market offering&rdquo;
as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The Sales Agent is not purchasing or selling any of the securities
offered pursuant to this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, and the Sales Agent is not required to arrange the purchase
or sale of any specific number of securities or dollar amount. The Sales Agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell on
our behalf all the Class A ordinary shares requested to be sold by us, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, on mutually
agreed terms between the Sales Agent and us. There is no arrangement for funds to be received in any escrow, trust or similar arrangement.&nbsp;We
will pay the Sales Agent as compensation a fixed commission rate of 2.5% of the gross proceeds of each sale of Class A ordinary shares.
In connection with the sale of Class A ordinary shares on our behalf, the Sales Agent will be deemed to be an &ldquo;underwriter&rdquo;
within the meaning of the Securities Act and the compensation of the Sales Agent will be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts.
We have also agreed to provide indemnification and contribution to the Sales Agent with respect to certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act. See &ldquo;Plan of Distribution.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The Class A ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq
Stock Market under the symbol &ldquo;NA.&rdquo; The last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares on August 20, 2025 was US$4.50
per Class A ordinary share.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We are subject to a number of prohibitions, restrictions
and potential delisting risks under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the &ldquo;HFCAA&rdquo;). Pursuant to the HFCAA and
related regulations, if we have filed an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) has determined that it is unable to inspect and investigate completely, the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) will identify us as a &ldquo;Commission-identified Issuer,&rdquo; and the trading of our
securities on any U.S. national securities exchange, as well as any over-the-counter trading in the United States, will be prohibited
if we are identified as a Commission-identified Issuer for two consecutive years. On December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2023 (the &ldquo;CAA&rdquo;) was signed into law by President Biden. The CAA, among other things, reduced the number of consecutive
non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA as it was originally passed from the original three years
to two, and thus, reduced the time before a Commission-identified Issuer&rsquo;s securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted.
In August 2022, the PCAOB, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the &ldquo;CSRC&rdquo;) and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC
signed a Statement of Protocol (the &ldquo;Statement of Protocol&rdquo;), which establishes a specific and accountable framework for the
PCAOB to conduct inspections and investigations of PCAOB-governed accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong. On December 15, 2022,
the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered
in mainland China and Hong Kong completely in 2022. The PCAOB Board vacated its previous 2021 determinations that the PCAOB was unable
to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. However, whether
the PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in
mainland China and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainties and depends on a number of factors out of our and our auditor&rsquo;s control.
The PCAOB continues to demand complete access in mainland China and Hong Kong moving forward and is making plans to resume regular inspections
in early 2023 and beyond, as well as to continue pursuing ongoing investigations and initiate new investigations as needed. The PCAOB
has also indicated that it will act immediately to consider the need to issue new determinations with the HFCAA if needed. Our auditor,
MaloneBailey, LLP, is not among the PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China and Hong Kong that are subject to
PCAOB&rsquo;s determination issued on December 16, 2021 of having been unable to inspect or investigate completely. However, we could
still face the risk of delisting and cease of trading of our securities from a stock exchange or an over-the-counter market in the United
States under the HFCAA and the securities regulations promulgated thereunder if the PCAOB determines in the future that it is unable to
completely inspect or investigate our auditor which has a presence in China. These China-related risks could result in a material change
in our operations and/or the value of our securities, or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue
to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. In particular, recent
policy statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to the cryptocurrency mining business, may adversely
impact our ability to conduct our business, accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign stock exchange, which may cause
our Class A ordinary shares to be prohibited from trading or to be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market or any other U.S. stock exchange.
See &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&rdquo; in our annual report
on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on April 11, 2025 (the &ldquo;2024 20-F&rdquo;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We face various legal and operational risks and
uncertainties related to being based in and having significant operations in China. The PRC government has significant authority to exert
influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on U.S. or
other foreign exchanges. For example, we face risks associated with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings and oversight on cybersecurity
and data privacy. The PRC government may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, or may exert control over operations of
our business, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our Class A ordinary shares. See also &ldquo;Risk
Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the
China operations of an offshore holding company, and offerings conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers, such
as us. Changes in China&rsquo;s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the value of our securities.&rdquo; We may need to make material changes
in our operations to comply with those requirements and/or the value of our Class A ordinary shares might be affected. PRC government&rsquo;s
certain administrative requirements in regulating our operations, the overseas offering and listing of China-based issuers, and foreign
investments could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Class A ordinary shares and/or
other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. The PRC government also
has significant discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene with or influence our operations or the development of the
relevant industry as it deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals, subject to necessary procedures. Uncertainties
regarding the enforcement of laws and that the rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice. See &ldquo;Risk
Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;Uncertainties with respect to the enforcement of and changes in laws
and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects,
and cause our Class A ordinary shares to significantly decline in value or become worthless,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks
Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;The PRC government has significant influence over companies with China-based operations
by enforcing existing rules and regulation, adopting new ones, or changing relevant industrial policies in a manner that may materially
increase our compliance cost, change relevant industry landscape or otherwise cause significant changes to our operations in China, which
could result in material and adverse changes in our operations and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.&rdquo;
Furthermore, the PRC government has recently exerted more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and foreign investment
in China-based companies, and these rules could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities
to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks
Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;Recent regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review or
otherwise restrict or completely hinder our ability to offer securities and raise capitals overseas, all of which could materially and
adversely affect our business and cause the value of our Class A ordinary shares to significantly decline or become worthless.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Investors in our Class A ordinary shares are not
purchasing equity securities of our subsidiaries that have substantive business operations in China but instead are purchasing equity
securities of a Cayman Islands holding company. Nano Labs Ltd is a holding company with no material operations of its own. We conduct
our operations primarily through our subsidiaries in China and our subsidiaries in Hong Kong. Such structure involves unique risks
to investors in our Class A ordinary shares. Investors may never directly hold equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries with substantive
operations. We also cannot assure you that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not disallow such a structure. If the Chinese regulatory
authorities disallow the structure, it would likely result in a material change in our operations and cause the value of our Class A
ordinary shares to significantly decline or become worthless. See &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related
to Our Corporate Structure and Governance&rdquo; in the 2024 20-F.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In recent years, the PRC government initiated
a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business operations in China with little advance
notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed
overseas, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. The
PRC government also exerts more control over offerings conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers. In particular,
on February 17, 2023, the CSRC released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies
(the &ldquo;Trial Measures&rdquo;), which came into effect on March 31, 2023. The Trial Measures apply to overseas securities offerings
and/or listings conducted by (1) companies incorporated in the PRC, or PRC domestic companies, directly and (2) companies incorporated
overseas with operations primarily in the PRC and valued on the basis of interests in PRC domestic companies, or indirect offerings.
The Trial Measures requires (i) the filings of the overseas offering and listing plan by the PRC domestic companies with the CSRC under
certain conditions, and (ii) the filing of their underwriters or placement agents with the CSRC under certain conditions and the submission
of an annual report to the CSRC within the required timeline. On the same day, the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives
Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the &ldquo;Confidentiality and Archives Administration
Provisions&rdquo;) promulgated by the CSRC came into effect. Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions stipulate that the
PRC companies seeking overseas offerings and listings, either directly or indirectly, as well as securities firms and securities service
providers (both the PRC and overseas) involved in relevant businesses, must not disclose any state secrets or confidential information
of government agencies, nor harm national security and public interests. Additionally, if a domestic company provides accounting archives
or copies of such archives to any entities, including securities firms, securities service providers, overseas regulators and individuals,
it must comply with due procedures in accordance with applicable regulations. We believe that offerings under this prospectus do not
involve the disclosure of any state secret or confidential information of government agencies, nor does it harm national security and
public interests. However, we may need to perform additional procedures concerning the provision of accounting archives. The specific
requirements of these procedures are currently unclear, and we cannot guarantee our ability to execute them. According to the Notice
on the Administrative Arrangements for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Enterprises (the &ldquo;Notice
on Overseas Listing Measures&rdquo;) published by the CSRC on February 17, 2023, issuers that had already been listed in an overseas
market by March 31, 2023, the date the Trial Measures became effective, are not required to make any immediate filing and are only required
to comply with the filing requirements under the Trial Measures when it subsequently seeks to conduct a follow-on offering. Therefore,
we are required to go through filing procedures with the CSRC within three working days after the completion of an offering made pursuant
to this prospectus or any accompanying prospectus supplement and for our future offerings of our securities in an overseas market, including
Nasdaq, under the Trial Measures. Other than the CSRC filing procedure we are required to make within three working days after the completion
of an offering made pursuant to this prospectus or any accompanying prospectus supplement, we and our PRC subsidiaries, as advised our
PRC legal counsel, Zhong Lun Law Firm, (1) are not required to obtain permissions from the CSRC, and (2) have not been required to obtain
or denied such and other permissions by the CSRC, CAC, or any PRC government authority, under current PRC laws, regulations and rules
in connection with a potential offering made pursuant to this prospectus or any accompanying prospectus supplement as of the date of
this prospectus. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;Recent
regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review or otherwise restrict or completely hinder our ability
to offer securities and raise capitals overseas, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and cause the value
of our Class A ordinary shares to significantly decline or become worthless&rdquo; in the 2024 20-F.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The structure of cash flows within our organization,
and the applicable regulations, are as follows. After foreign investors&rsquo; funds enter Nano Labs Ltd, our holding company, subject
to the cash demand of our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries, the funds can be transferred to our wholly owned Cayman subsidiaries, then
to our wholly owned BVI subsidiaries, then to our Hong Kong subsidiaries, which will further distribute the funds to our PRC subsidiaries.
If we intend to distribute dividends, PRC subsidiaries will transfer the dividends to our Hong Kong subsidiaries in accordance with the
laws and regulations of the PRC, and then our Hong Kong subsidiaries will transfer the dividends all the way up to Nano Labs Ltd, and
the dividends will be distributed from Nano Labs Ltd to all shareholders respectively in proportion to the shares they hold, regardless
of whether the shareholders are U.S. investors or investors in other countries or regions. The cross-border transfer of funds within
our corporate group under our direct holding structure must be legal and compliant with relevant laws and regulations of China. In utilizing
the proceeds from offerings under this prospectus, as an offshore holding company, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to
provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our affiliated entities only through loans,
subject to applicable government reporting, registration and approvals. See &ldquo;Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security
Holders and Use of Proceeds&mdash;Use of Proceeds&rdquo; and &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related
to Conducting Business in China&mdash;PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies
and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of the securities offering to make loans
or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries&rdquo; in the 2024 20-F. In 2022, 2023 and 2024, we transferred cash proceeds
of US$24.3 million, US$17.5 million and US$13.1 million to our PRC subsidiaries for the settlement of intercompany transactions and as
paid-in capital for our PRC subsidiaries, and none of our PRC subsidiaries has issued any dividends or distributions to respective holding
companies or any investors as of the date of this prospectus. We do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary
shares . We have, from time to time, transferred cash between our PRC subsidiaries to fund their operations, and we do not anticipate
any difficulties or limitations on our ability to transfer cash between such subsidiaries. As of the date of this prospectus, no cash
generated from our PRC subsidiaries has been used to fund operations of any of our non-PRC subsidiaries. We may encounter difficulties
in our ability to transfer cash between PRC subsidiaries and non-PRC subsidiaries largely due to various PRC laws and regulations imposed
on foreign exchange. However, as long as we are compliant with the procedures for approvals from foreign exchange authorities and banks
in China, the relevant laws and regulations in China do not impose limitations on the amount of funds that we can transfer out of China.
We currently do not have any cash management policy that dictate the transfer of cash between our subsidiaries. See &ldquo;Item 4. Information
of the Company&mdash;B. Business Overview&mdash;Regulation&mdash;PRC Laws and Regulations relating to Foreign Exchange&rdquo; in the
2024 20-F for details of such procedures.</P>

to 30 votes on all matters subject to vote at general meetings of our company. Each Class B ordinary share can be convertible into Class
A ordinary share at any time at the option of the holder thereof. Class A ordinary shares shall not be convertible into Class B ordinary

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We are a leading Web 3.0 infrastructure and
product solution provider in China, specialized in the development of HTC chips and HPC chips. We have built a comprehensive FPU
architecture which offers solution that integrates the features of both HTC and HPC. In addition, we have actively positioned
ourselves in the crypto assets space, adopting BNB as our primary reserve asset. As of August 20, 2025, we have accumulated
nearly US$180 million in mainstream cryptocurrencies including BNB and BTC.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We plan to further strengthen our BNB strategic
reserve through multiple approaches, including continued accumulation of BNB, acquisition of controlling stakes in BNB-focused strategic
reserve entities, and investment in companies dedicated to holding BNB as a core reserve asset.</P>
<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We have established an integrated solution platform
covering two main&nbsp;business verticals, including HTC solutions and HPC solutions. Our HTC solutions feature our proprietary&nbsp;Cuckoo&nbsp;series
chips, which have become alternative ASICs solutions for traditional GPUs. Our HPC solutions offer both HPC chips,&nbsp;Darkbird, and
Bitcoin mining machine,&nbsp;iPollo. In addition to HTC and HPC chips, we launched our&nbsp;Darksteel&nbsp;series, which can be applied
to both industrial and commercial sectors by offering distributed computing and data storage solutions, in the fourth quarter of 2021.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">BNB functions as the core
utility and governance token within the BNB chain ecosystem (BNB Chain), supporting diversified use cases primarily including decentralized
finance (DeFi), centralized finance (CeFi), and payment solutions (PayFi). BNB operates as a multifunctional, scalable blockchain infrastructure
token essential to BNB Chain&rsquo;s ecosystem operations and innovation. BNB may be utilized to enable transaction fee payments, staking/governance
participation, liquid staking derivatives, CeFi privileges, real-world payments, decentralized storage, and financial services, while
supporting ecosystem growth through validator rewards and protocol governance.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left"><B><I>&nbsp;</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left"><I>BNB Token Supply Mechanisms</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left"><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">BNB was launched in 2017 with an initial total supply of 200 million
tokens. The protocol operates a deflationary model that progressively reduces supply. As of July 2025 following the 32<SUP>nd</SUP> quarterly
burn event, BNB&rsquo;s total supply stood at approximately 139.29 million tokens.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">For the token generation mechanism, BNB implements
zero post-launch token minting, eliminating inflationary mechanisms. Supply reduction occurs exclusively through burning. Cross-chain
transfers between BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and BNB Greenfield utilize lock/unlock protocols, and there is no new token creation for BNB.</P>
<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">For the burn mechanism, BNB
employs two primary burn mechanisms, including (1) auto-burn, which executes algorithmic quarterly burns based on BNB market price and
BSC block production metrics, which constitutes an auditable, transparent on-chain process independent of centralized exchanges, and
(2) real-time burn, which destroys a portion of BSC gas fees per block where governance mechanisms determine the burn ratio, dynamically
adjusting according to network activity.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, BNB operates as a deflationary token.
The auto-burn and real-time burn mechanisms systematically reduce total supply. There is no inflation mechanism for BNB, as it prohibits
new token creation.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The BNB ecosystem comprises multiple blockchains,
including BSC, opBNB (Layer-2 scaling solution), and BNB Greenfield (decentralized storage network), collectively establishing infrastructure
supporting Web3, DeFi, AI, and data tokenization innovations. BNB serves as the core utility token enabling payment fees, staking, governance,
storage, and real-world transactions across this ecosystem.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">BNB commenced its lifecycle
with a genesis event in 2017, launching via an initial coin offering where 200 million tokens were minted. It initially existed as an
Ethereum ERC-20 token before migrating to become the native token of BNB Chain. The protocol explicitly prohibits the creation of any
new tokens after this genesis event.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We maintain our cryptocurrency holdings in wallets hosted on reputable
exchanges, including Hashkey Exchange, CEFFU, Coinbase and Binance. The selection of these exchanges involves a careful evaluation of
their security measures, regulatory compliance, and requires approval by our senior management. When establishing new wallets, an operational
representative and two additional reviewers are required to be physically present. Wallet passwords are set and securely maintained by
one designated reviewer. We employ a robust &ldquo;3-of-2&rdquo; multi-signature security arrangement to enhance protection, requiring
multiple authorized signatures to authorize transactions. Hardware wallets are securely stored in dedicated safes. Software wallets are
utilized strictly as transitional platforms, facilitating individual incoming and outgoing transactions without retaining balances, thereby
minimizing exposure and enhancing security. Our auditor performs annual procedures in compliance with PCAOB rules, including existence
verification, to reasonably assure the balance of our cryptocurrency assets reported in the consolidated balance sheets are free of material
misstatement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Nearly 40.0% of our cryptocurrency assets is custodied by CEFFU, a secure
and independent institutional custody platform specializing in virtual asset safekeeping. Operating as an independent entity, CEFFU maintains
rigorous security protocols, compliance standards, and governance frameworks. For our cryptocurrency assets stored in CEFFU, we are not
aware of the proportion of private keys that are held in hot, warm or cold storage. The cryptocurrency holdings stored by the CEFFU are
completely segregated and verifiable on-chain. CEFFU has SOC II Type II audits from its auditor to ensure the security of our cryptocurrency
assets. Specifically, CEFFU utilizes multi-party computation technology to eliminate single points of private key vulnerability. By distributing
key shares across FIPS 140-2 compliant hardware security modules with strict non-exportability controls, this cryptographic architecture
ensures end-to-end protection against key compromise. However, CEFFU does not provide insurance on client assets under custody. Instead,
CEFFU maintains its own internal risk management and asset allocation policies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Per our agreement with CEFFU, we are obligated
to provide and maintain current and precise KYC/AML documentation. CEFFU conducts rigorous identity verification, continuously
monitors transactions for suspicious activity, and adheres strictly to anti-money laundering regulations. Fees for services are
detailed in a separate fee letter and may be adjusted by CEFFU with prior notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement
with thirty days&rsquo; written notice. In addition, CEFFU retains the unilateral right to immediately suspend or close accounts in
cases of material breaches, fraudulent activities, regulatory enforcement actions, or violations of AML requirements.</P>

according to its internal policy. As a result, we lack visibility into the custody arrangements, including how the private key is stored,
whether there is potential commingling with other client assets, and whether Binance maintains insurance coverage for our holdings.</P>

of risk. Before investing in our Class A ordinary shares, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties summarized below,
the risks described under the &ldquo;Risk Factors,&rdquo; in addition to all of the other information in this prospectus and documents
that are incorporated in this prospectus , as updated by our subsequent filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;), and, if applicable, in any accompanying prospectus supplement or documents incorporated by reference.
The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the section titled &ldquo;Risk Factors,&rdquo; and those included

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Nano Labs Ltd is a holding company with no material
operations of its own. We conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong. As a result, Nano Labs Ltd&rsquo;s
ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong. If our existing PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries
or any newly formed ones incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability
to pay dividends to us. We face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties related to being based in and having significant
operations in China. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as
us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on U.S. or other foreign exchanges. For example, we face risks associated
with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings and oversight on cybersecurity and data privacy. The PRC government may intervene in or
influence our operations at any time, or may exert control over operations of our business, which could result in a material change in
our operations and/or the value of our Class A ordinary shares. See also &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business

or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition,
and the value of our securities.&rdquo; We may need to make material changes in our operations to comply with those requirements and/or
the value of our Class A ordinary shares might be affected. PRC government&rsquo;s certain administrative requirements in regulating our
operations, the overseas offering and listing of China-based issuers, and foreign investments could significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Class A ordinary shares and/or other securities to investors and cause the value
of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. The PRC government also has significant discretion over the conduct of our
business and may intervene with or influence our operations or the development of the relevant industry as it deems appropriate to further
regulatory, political and societal goals, subject to necessary procedures. Uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and that the
rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting
Business in China&mdash;Uncertainties with respect to the enforcement of and changes in laws and regulations in China could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects, and cause our Class A ordinary shares
to significantly decline in value or become worthless,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;The
PRC government has significant influence over companies with China-based operations by enforcing existing rules and regulation, adopting
new ones, or changing relevant industrial policies in a manner that may materially increase our compliance cost, change relevant industry
landscape or otherwise cause significant changes to our operations in China, which could result in material and adverse changes in our
operations and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.&rdquo; Furthermore, the PRC government has
recently exerted more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and foreign investment in China-based companies, and these
rules could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value
of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting
Business in China&mdash;Recent regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review or otherwise restrict or
completely hinder our ability to offer securities and raise capitals overseas, all of which could materially and adversely affect our

asset strategy focusing on BNB may subject us to various operational risks. The BNB token operates on blockchain technology and
networks, including the BNB Chain, which may contain bugs, errors, and vulnerabilities which may materially and adversely affect the
value of our BNB reserves. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Our Operations&mdash;Technical flaws, security breaches,
or failures within the BNB blockchain ecosystem could impair the utility value of our BNB holdings.&rdquo; BNB derives significant
value from its association with and utility across platforms operated by Binance, adverse developments affecting Biance may cause

technology, more popular platforms, or changes in developer or user preferences could render BNB or the BNB Chain ecosystem less
competitive or obsolete. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Our Operations&mdash;Significant concentration of reserve
value in BNB amplifies exposure to token-specific failures. Competition and potential technological obsolescence may adversely
impact BNB&rsquo;s value.&rdquo; As a significant holder of BNB, our attempts to sell large quantities could materially exceed
market depth at desired prices, thus adversely affecting the value of our entire reserve position. See &ldquo;Risk
Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Our Operations&mdash;Our BNB holdings may face unique liquidity challenges or devaluation due to
concentration or market perception. Liquidity constraints may prevent us from converting BNB holdings into fiat currency or stable
value when needed, or without significant losses.&rdquo; Our reserve asset strategy concentrates significant value in BNB, and any
BNB-specific risks will disproportionately and adversely affect the value of our reserves compared to a more diversified portfolio.

sufficient depth to execute large transactions without significantly impacting its price, and we may not be able to liquidate our
BNB reserves at necessary times, or only at distressed prices. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Our

risks. You should carefully consider all the information in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left"><B><I>Significant volatility in the market price
of BNB may cause material losses and adversely affect our financial position.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">In 2024, we formally adopted BTC as our primary
reserve asset. During the second quarter of 2025, our management conducted a comprehensive review of prevailing market models for cryptocurrency reserve programs. Following rigorous internal evaluation, our management determined that BNB exhibited had shown considerable
market potential, and accordingly, we strategically reallocated our cryptocurrency reserve to focus exclusively on BNB.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">We hold BNB as a reserve asset
and intend to acquire additional BNB, exposing us to extreme price fluctuations inherent in crypto assets. The market value of BNB may
experience rapid, severe, and unpredictable declines due to factors including regulatory actions, market sentiment, technological changes,
macroeconomic conditions, or liquidity constraints. A material decline in BNB&rsquo;s value could substantially reduce the value of our
reserve assets, adversely affecting our liquidity, financial position, and results of operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B><I>BNB&rsquo;s value and utility are heavily dependent on the ongoing
operation, success, and reputation of Binance and its affiliates, exposing our reserves to material devaluation.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">BNB derives significant value
from its association with and utility across platforms operated by Binance. Adverse developments affecting Binance, including regulatory
sanctions, legal proceedings, operational failures, financial instability, reputational damage, loss of market share, or a decline in
the adoption of Binance-related services, could rapidly erode confidence in and demand for BNB, causing its market price to decline substantially
and materially harming the value of our holdings.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">As
the issuer and primary governing authority of BNB, Binance exerts centralized control over critical token attributes including </FONT>burn
mechanisms<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">, distribution protocols, utility features, staking rewards, and technological
infrastructure. Binance may implement changes without our consent that reduce token scarcity, diminish utility, alter fee structures,
or disadvantage holders. Such actions could materially erode BNB&rsquo;s market value and directly impair our reserve assets. Furthermore,
adverse developments affecting Binance&rsquo;s financial stability, regulatory, reputation, or operational integrity may severely undermine
market confidence in BNB, triggering price declines that disproportionately impact our concentrated holdings.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left"><B><I>Significant concentration of reserve value
in BNB amplifies exposure to token-specific failures. Competition and potential technological obsolescence may adversely impact BNB&rsquo;s
value.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">Our reserve asset strategy
concentrates significant value in BNB. This concentration amplifies our exposure to BNB-specific risks, including technological obsolescence,
competition from other crypto assets, reputational damage to Binance or the BNB ecosystem, protocol failures, or governance disputes.
Failure of BNB to maintain its functionality, market position, or value will disproportionately and adversely affect the value of our
reserves compared to a more diversified portfolio.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">BNB faces intense competition
and rapid technological change. Numerous other blockchain platforms, tokens, and cryptocurrencies compete with BNB Chain and BNB for users,
developers, and market share. The emergence of superior technology, more popular platforms, or changes in developer or user preferences
could render BNB or the BNB Chain ecosystem less competitive or obsolete, materially reducing demand for and the value of our BNB holdings.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B><I>Our BNB holdings may face unique liquidity challenges or devaluation
due to concentration or market perception. Liquidity constraints may prevent us from converting BNB holdings into fiat currency or stable
value when needed, or without significant losses.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">As a significant holder of
BNB, our attempts to sell large quantities could materially exceed market depth at desired prices, especially during periods of stress,
forcing us to accept significant discounts. Furthermore, market perception of our holdings as a potential overhang or association with
Binance-related risks could independently exert downward pressure on BNB&rsquo;s price, adversely affecting the value of our entire reserve
position.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">Our ability to convert BNB
holdings into liquid assets may be constrained. BNB markets may lack sufficient depth to execute large transactions without significantly
impacting its price. Exchange failures, trading suspensions, withdrawal restrictions, or operational disruptions at major trading platforms
could impede our ability to liquidate BNB promptly or at desired prices. Inability to access or liquidate our BNB reserves at necessary
times, or only at distressed prices, may materially impair our treasury management and ability to fund operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left"><B><I>Technical flaws, security breaches, or failures
within the BNB blockchain ecosystem could impair the utility value of our BNB holdings.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">The BNB token operates on blockchain
technology and networks, including the BNB Chain, which may contain undetected bugs, vulnerabilities, or experience operational disruptions.
A significant security breach, network failure, consensus mechanism flaw, or successful attack targeting the BNB Chain or associated infrastructure
could compromise the integrity of the network, disrupt transactions, or lead to loss of tokens, materially diminishing the value or usability
of our BNB holdings.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left"><B><I>The PRC government has significant authority
to exert influence on the China operations of an offshore holding company, and offerings conducted overseas and foreign investment in
China-based issuers, such as us. Changes in China&rsquo;s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the value of our securities.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">We conduct our business in
China and substantially all of our assets are located in China. Accordingly, our business, results of operations and financial condition
may be influenced to a significant degree by the PRC political, economic, and social conditions. The PRC government may intervene or influence
our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities. The PRC government
has released regulations and policies that have significantly impacted various industries in general and specific operators within such
industries, and may in the future release new regulations or policies that could intervene in or influence our operations or the industry
sectors in which we operate. The PRC government may also require us to obtain new permits or approvals to continue our operations. If
we fail to comply with these regulations, policies or requirements, it could result in a material change in our operations or significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to investors and cause the value
of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to significantly decline or become worthless. Therefore, investors of our company and our business
face uncertainties from potential actions taken by regulators that may affect our business and the value of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">Our ability to successfully
maintain or grow business operations in China also depends on various factors, which are beyond our control. These factors include, among
others, macro-economic and other market conditions, political stability, social conditions, measures to control inflation or deflation,
changes in the rate or method of taxation, changes in laws, regulations and administrative directives or their interpretation, and changes
in industry policies. If we fail to take timely and appropriate measures to adapt to any of the changes or challenges, our business, results
of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left"><B><I>Uncertainties with respect to the enforcement
of and changes in laws and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">The PRC legal system is a civil
law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions in a civil law system may be cited as reference
but have limited precedential value. The interpretations of such laws and regulations may evolve rapidly, and enforcement of these laws
and regulations involves significant uncertainties.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">Moreover, developments in our
industry&nbsp;and other industries and that we are and will be involved in&nbsp;may lead to changes in PRC laws, regulations and policies
or in the interpretation and application thereof. As a result, we may be required by the regulators to upgrade or obtain the licenses,
permits, approvals, to complete additional filings or registrations for the products and services we offer, or to modify business practices
that may subject us to various penalties, including criminal penalties for individual and entity. We cannot assure you that our business
operations would not be deemed to violate any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, which in turn could materially and adversely
affect our business operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">Furthermore, the PRC legal
system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis, or at all, and may
have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the
violation. Such unpredictability and uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to you and us, significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, cause significant disruption to our business operations,
and severely damage our reputation, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and
cause our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to significantly decline in value or become worthless.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">From time to time, we may have
to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. Any administrative and court proceedings in China may be
protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management&rsquo;s attention. Since PRC administrative and court
authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be more difficult
to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal
systems. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into and could materially and adversely affect
our business and results of operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">These uncertainties may also
affect our decisions on the policies and actions to be taken to comply with PRC laws and regulations, and may affect our ability to enforce
contractual rights, property (including intellectual property) or tort rights. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited

may subject us to additional regulatory review or otherwise restrict or completely hinder our ability to offer securities and raise capitals
overseas, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and cause the value of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to significantly
decline or become worthless.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">The recent regulatory developments
in China, in particular with respect to restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore, may lead to additional regulatory
review in China over our financing and capital raising activities in the United&nbsp;States. Pursuant to the PRC Cybersecurity Law, which
was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People&rsquo;s Congress on November&nbsp;7, 2016 and took effect on June&nbsp;1,
2017, personal information and important data collected and generated by a critical information infrastructure operator in the course
of its operations in China must be stored in China, and if a critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products
and services that affects or may affect national security, it should be subject to cybersecurity review by the Cybersecurity Administration
of China, or the CAC.&nbsp;The PRC Cybersecurity Law also establishes more stringent requirements applicable to operators of computer
networks, especially to operators of networks which involve critical information infrastructure. The PRC Cybersecurity Law contains an
overarching framework for regulating Internet security, protection of private and sensitive information, and safeguards for national cyberspace
security and provisions for the continued government regulation of the Interne and content available in China. The PRC Cybersecurity Law
emphasizes requirements for network products, services, operations and information security, as well as monitoring, early detection, emergency
response and reporting. Due to the lack of further interpretations, the exact scope of &ldquo;critical information infrastructure operator&rdquo;
remains unclear. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures announced jointly by the CAC, the National Development and Reform Commission
and other government agencies on December&nbsp;28, 2021, which became effective on February&nbsp;15, 2022, the scope of cybersecurity
reviews is extended to data processing operators engaging in data processing activities that affect or may affect national security. The
Cybersecurity Review Measures further requires that any operator applying for listing of its securities on a foreign stock exchange must
go through cybersecurity review if it possesses personal information of more than one million users. According to the Cybersecurity Review
Measures, a cybersecurity review assesses potential national security risk that may be brought about by any procurement, data processing,
or overseas listing. The review focuses on several factors, including, among others, (1)&nbsp;the risk of theft, leakage, corruption,
illegal use or export of any core or important data, or a large amount of personal information, and (2)&nbsp;the risk of any critical
information infrastructure, core or important data, or a large amount of personal information being affected, controlled or maliciously
exploited by a&nbsp;foreign government after a company is listed overseas. While the Cybersecurity Review Measures has become final, there
is still uncertainty regarding, among many aspects, the implementation and interpretation of the Cybersecurity Review Measures.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">Under the current Cybersecurity
Review Measures, subject to any further interpretation of the CAC and other relevant authorities, we believe we may not be subject to
the cybersecurity review by the CAC, as we are primarily engaged in the design and manufacturing of ICs or do not process any data in
our business. However, there remains uncertainty as to how the Cybersecurity Review Measures will be interpreted or implemented and whether
the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation
related to the Draft Measures. We cannot assure you that PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, would take the same view as we do,
and we cannot assure you that we can fully or timely comply with such legal or regulatory requirements. If we become subject to cybersecurity
inspection and/or review by the CAC or other PRC authorities or are required by them to take any specific actions, it could cause suspension
or termination of the future offering of our securities, including offerings under this registration statement, disruptions to our operations,
result in negative publicity regarding our company, and divert our managerial and financial resources. We may also be subject to significant
fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any
actions by the PRC government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment
in companies having operations in China, including us, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue
to offer securities to investors, and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left"><B><I>The PRC government has significant influence
over companies with China-based operations by enforcing existing rules and regulation, adopting new ones, or changing relevant industrial
policies in a manner that may materially increase our compliance cost, change relevant industry landscape or otherwise cause significant
changes to our operations in China, which could result in material and adverse changes in our operations and cause the value of our securities
to significantly decline or be worthless.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">The PRC government has significant influence over China-based operations of any company by allocating
resources, providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies, or imposing industry-wide policies on certain industries.
The PRC government may also amend or enforce existing rules and regulation or adopt new ones, which could materially increase our compliance
cost, change the relevant industry landscape, or cause significant changes to our business operations. In addition, the PRC regulatory
system is based in part on government policies and internal guidance, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and
some of which may even have a retroactive effect. We may not be aware of all non-compliance incidents at all time, and may face regulatory
investigation, fines and other penalties as a result. As a result of any changes in the government-mandated industrial policies, including
the amendment to and/or enforcement of the related laws and regulations, companies with China-based operations, including us, and the
industries in which we operate could face significant compliance and operational risks and uncertainties. For example, in July&nbsp;2021,
the PRC government released a broad set of reforms targeting private education companies providing after-school tutoring services and
prohibiting foreign investments in institutions providing such after-school tutoring services. As a result, the market value of certain
U.S.&nbsp;listed companies with China-based operations in the affected sectors declined substantially. The PRC government has also imposed
severe restrictions over the operations of cryptocurrency business, which has drastically changed industry landscape in China, and as
a result, due to the possible change of regulation, it may be illegal to acquire, own, hold, sell or use cryptocurrencies, participate
in the blockchain business, or transfer or utilize cryptocurrency assets in China. In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission
of China has classified cryptocurrency mining operations as an industry to be eliminated. We have adopted a development strategy to expand
our business and promote our products and solution offerings globally. If industry-wide regulations or policies are adopted in China in
a way that significantly curtails or prohibits the research and development of our solution offerings and other aspects of our business,
our operations in China will be materially and adversely affected, and we may have to cease our operations in China and relocate our offices
and assets overseas, which may significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.</P>

suffer immediate and substantial dilution of US$0.77 per our ordinary share with respect to the net tangible book value of  our ordinary

of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will trade.
The securities of some China-based&nbsp;companies that have listed their securities in the United&nbsp;States have experienced significant
volatility since their initial public offerings in recent&nbsp;years, including, in some cases, substantial declines in the trading prices
of their securities. The trading performances of these companies&rsquo; securities after their offerings may affect the attitudes of
investors towards Chinese companies listed in the United&nbsp;States in general, which consequently may impact the trading performance
of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, any negative news or perceptions about
inadequate corporate governance practices or fraudulent accounting, corporate structure or other matters of other Chinese companies may
also negatively affect the attitudes of investors towards Chinese companies in general, including us, regardless of whether we have engaged
in any inappropriate activities. In particular, the global financial crisis, the ensuing economic recessions and deterioration in the
credit market in many countries have contributed and may continue to contribute to extreme volatility in the global stock markets.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Moreover, there have been recent instances of
extreme stock price run-ups&nbsp;followed by rapid price declines and strong stock price volatility with a number of recent initial public
offerings, particularly among companies with relatively smaller public floats. As we have a relatively small public float, we may experience
greater stock price volatility, including aggressive price run-ups&nbsp;and declines, lower trading volume and less liquidity, compared
with companies with larger public floats. In particular, our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares may be subject to rapid and substantial price
volatility, low volumes of trades and large spreads in bid and ask prices. Such volatility, including any stock run-up, may be unrelated
to our actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or prospects, and industry, market or economic factors, which makes
it difficult for prospective investors to assess such rapidly changing value of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. In addition, if the
trading volumes of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares are low, persons buying or selling in relatively small quantities may easily influence
prices of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. This low volume of trades could also cause the price of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares
to fluctuate significantly, with large percentage changes in price occurring in any&nbsp;trading day session. Holders of our Class&nbsp;A
ordinary shares may also not be able to readily liquidate their investment or may be forced to sell at depressed prices due to such low-volume&nbsp;trading.
As a result of such volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. Such volatility
also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or other securities and our ability to obtain
additional financing in the future, as well as our ability to retain key employees, many of whom have been granted equity incentives.
Furthermore, the potential extreme volatility may confuse the public investors of the value of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, distort
the market perception of the price of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, and our financial performance and public image, and negatively
affect the long-term&nbsp;liquidity of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, regardless of our actual or expected operating performance.</P>

have often brought securities class action suits against companies following periods of instability in the market price of their securities.
If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management&rsquo;s attention and other resources
from our business and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such
class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition,
if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect

In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding
companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government
approvals or filings on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries or with respect to future
capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to
use the proceeds from the securities offering and to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which
could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. See &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk
Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by
offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of the securities
offering to make loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries&rdquo; in the 2024 Form 20-F.</P>

may be diluted to the extent of the difference between the price you pay for each share in this offering and the net tangible book value
per ordinary share immediately after this offering.&nbsp;Our net tangible book value on June 30, 2025 was US$80.0 million, or
US$3.46 per ordinary share. &ldquo;Net tangible book value&rdquo; is total assets minus the sum of liabilities and intangible assets.
&ldquo;Net tangible book value per share&rdquo; is net tangible book value divided by the total number of shares outstanding.</P>

individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax

The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties applicable to payments to or by our company. There are no exchange control

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Under the EIT Law and its implementation rules,
an enterprise established outside of China with a &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; within China is considered a resident enterprise
and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The implementation rules define the term &ldquo;de
facto management body&rdquo; as the body that exercises full and substantial control over and overall management of the business, productions,
personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April&nbsp;2009, SAT issued Circular Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled&nbsp;Offshore
Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprise on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or SAT Circular&nbsp;82, which provides
certain specific criteria for determining whether the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; of a PRC-controlled&nbsp;enterprise that
is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although SAT Circular 82 only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises
or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in SAT Circular 82 may reflect
the general position of SAT on how the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; test should be applied in determining the tax resident
status of all offshore enterprises. According to SAT Circular&nbsp;82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise
or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; in China
only if all of the following conditions are met: (1)&nbsp;the primary location of the&nbsp;day-to-day&nbsp;operational management is
in China; (2)&nbsp;decisions relating to the enterprise&rsquo;s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval
by organizations or personnel in China; (3)&nbsp;the enterprise&rsquo;s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals,
and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in China; and (4)&nbsp;at least 50% of voting board members or senior
executives habitually reside in China.</P>

our Cayman Islands holding company meets all of the conditions above. Our Cayman Islands holding company is not a PRC resident enterprise
for PRC tax purposes. As a holding company, its key assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries, and its key assets are located,
and its records (including the resolutions of its board of directors and the resolutions of its shareholders) are maintained, outside
China. For the same reasons, we believe our other entities outside of China are not PRC resident enterprises either. However, the tax
resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the
interpretation of the term &ldquo;de facto management body.&rdquo; There can be no assurance that the PRC government will ultimately
take a view that is consistent with ours.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">Zhong Lun Law Firm, our
legal counsel as to PRC law, has advised us that if the PRC tax authorities determine that our Cayman Islands holding company is a PRC
resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we may be required to withhold a 10% withholding tax from dividends we pay to
our shareholders that are non-resident&nbsp;enterprises with no institutions or premises established in the PRC or income bearing no
de facto relationship with the institution or premises established. In addition, non-resident&nbsp;enterprise shareholders may be subject
to a 10% PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within
China. It is unclear whether our non-PRC&nbsp;individual shareholders would be subject to any PRC tax on dividends or gains obtained
by such non-PRC&nbsp;individual shareholders in the event we are determined to be a PRC resident enterprise. If any PRC tax were to apply
to such dividends or gains, it would generally apply at a rate of 20% unless a reduced rate is available under an applicable tax treaty.
However, it is also unclear whether non-PRC&nbsp;shareholders of our Cayman Islands holding company would be able to claim the benefits
of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and China in the event that our Cayman Islands holding company is treated
as a PRC resident enterprise.</P>

Islands holding company is not deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, holders of the ordinary shares who are not PRC residents will
not be subject to PRC income tax on dividends distributed by us or gains realized from the sale or other disposition of our shares. However,
where a non-resident&nbsp;enterprise conducts an &ldquo;indirect transfer&rdquo; by transferring taxable assets, including, in particular,
equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise, indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident&nbsp;enterprise,
being the transferor, or the transferee or the PRC entity which directly owned such taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority
such indirect transfer. Using a &ldquo;substance over form&rdquo; principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the
overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring
PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee obligated
to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. We and
our non-PRC&nbsp;resident investors may be at risk of being required to file a return and being taxed under SAT Circular&nbsp;7, and
we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Circular&nbsp;7, or to establish that we should not be taxed thereunder.
See &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Relating to Conducting Business in China&mdash;We may
be subject to enterprise income tax on our worldwide income if our company or any of our subsidiaries were considered a PRC &lsquo;resident

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">A non-United&nbsp;States
corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a &ldquo;passive foreign investment company,&rdquo; or a PFIC, for United&nbsp;States
federal income tax purposes, if, in the case of any particular taxable year, either (1)&nbsp;75% or more of its gross income for such
year consists of certain types of &ldquo;passive&rdquo; income or (2)&nbsp;50% or more of its average quarterly assets during such year
is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, cash is categorized as a passive
asset and the company&rsquo;s unbooked intangibles associated with active business activities may generally be classified as active assets.
For purposes of the income test, &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; generally consists of sales revenues less the cost of goods sold, together
with income from investments and from other sources, and &ldquo;passive income&rdquo; generally includes, among other things, dividends,
interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the disposition of passive assets. We will be treated as owning our proportionate share of
the assets and earning our proportionate share of the income of any other non-United&nbsp;States corporation in which we own, directly
or indirectly, more than 25% (by value) of the stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">Based upon our historical
income and assets and the value of our Class A ordinary shares, we do not believe we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December&nbsp;31,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">While we reasonably
do not expect to become a PFIC in the current or future taxable&nbsp;years, the determination of whether we are or will become a
PFIC will depend upon (i)&nbsp;the composition and characterization of our income (which may differ from our historical results and
current projections) and (ii)&nbsp;the composition and characterization of our assets and the value of our assets from time to time,
including, in particular the value of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles (which may depend upon the market value of our
Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares from time to time&nbsp;and which has been and may continue to be volatile). In estimating the value of
our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, we have taken into account our market capitalization, which has fluctuated
significantly. Among other matters, if our market capitalization does not increase or continues to decline, we may be or become
classified as a PFIC for the current or future taxable&nbsp;years. It is also possible that the IRS may challenge our classification
of assets or income or the valuation of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, which may result in our company being, or
becoming classified as, a PFIC for the current or one or more future taxable&nbsp;years.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">The determination of
whether we would be or become a PFIC may also depend, in part, on how, and how quickly, we used our liquid assets. Under circumstances
where we retain significant amounts of liquid assets, including cash, our risk of being classified as a PFIC may substantially increase.
Because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules and PFIC status is a factual determination made annually after
the close of each taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for the current taxable year ending December&nbsp;31,
2025 or any future taxable year. If we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S.&nbsp;Holder holds our Class&nbsp;A
ordinary shares, we generally would continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding&nbsp;years during which such U.S.&nbsp;Holder
holds our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares.</P>

be includible in the gross income of a U.S.&nbsp;Holder as dividend income on the&nbsp;day actually or constructively received by the
U.S.&nbsp;Holder of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of
United&nbsp;States federal income tax principles, any distribution will generally be treated as a &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; for United&nbsp;States
federal income tax purposes. Under current law, a non-corporate&nbsp;recipient of dividend income will generally be subject to tax on
dividend income from a &ldquo;qualified foreign corporation&rdquo; at the lower applicable net capital gains rate rather than the marginal
tax rates generally applicable to ordinary income, provided that certain holding period and other requirements are met.</P>

taxable year) will generally be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (1)&nbsp;if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive
tax treaty with the United&nbsp;States, which the Secretary of Treasury of the United&nbsp;States determines is satisfactory for purposes
of this provision and which includes an exchange of information program, or (2)&nbsp;with respect to any dividend it pays on stock which
is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United&nbsp;States. Our Class A ordinary shares are considered for purposes
of clause (2) above to be readily tradeable on an established securities market in the United&nbsp;States because they are listed on
the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, there can be no assurance that our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will continue to be considered readily
tradable on an established securities market in later&nbsp;years. In the event we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the
Enterprise Income Tax Law (see &ldquo;&mdash;&nbsp;PRC Taxation&rdquo;), we may be eligible for the benefits of the Agreement Between
the Government of the United&nbsp;States of America and the Government of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China for the Avoidance of Double
Taxation and the Prevention of Tax Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, or the United&nbsp;States-PRC&nbsp;income tax treaty (which
the Secretary of the Treasury of the United&nbsp;States has determined is satisfactory for this purpose), in which case we would be treated
as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. U.S.&nbsp;Holders are urged to
consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate on dividends in their particular circumstances. Dividends
received on our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to qualifying corporations
under the Code.</P>

A U.S.&nbsp;Holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any foreign
withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. A U.S.&nbsp;Holder who does not elect to claim a
foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld may instead claim a deduction for United&nbsp;States federal income tax purposes in respect
of such withholding, but only for a year in which such holder elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes. The rules governing
the foreign tax&nbsp;credit are complex. U.S.&nbsp;Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the
foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.</P>

be given regarding whether our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will qualify, or will continue to be qualified, as being regularly traded

in each year that we are a PFIC any gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will be treated
as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We are subject to a number of prohibitions, restrictions
and potential delisting risks under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the &ldquo;HFCAA&rdquo;). Pursuant to the HFCAA and
related regulations, if we have filed an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) has determined that it is unable to inspect and investigate completely, the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) will identify us as a &ldquo;Commission-identified Issuer,&rdquo; and the trading of our
securities on any U.S. national securities exchange, as well as any over-the-counter trading in the United States, will be prohibited
if we are identified as a Commission-identified Issuer for two consecutive years. On December&nbsp;29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2023 (the &ldquo;CAA&rdquo;) was signed into law by President Biden. The CAA, among other things, reduced the number of consecutive
non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA as it was originally passed from the original three years
to two, and thus, reduced the time before a Commission-identified Issuer&rsquo;s securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted.
In August 2022, the PCAOB, the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC signed a Statement of Protocol (the &ldquo;Statement of Protocol&rdquo;),
which establishes a specific and accountable framework for the PCAOB to conduct inspections and investigations of PCAOB-governed accounting
firms in mainland China and Hong Kong. On December&nbsp;15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect
and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong completely in 2022. The PCAOB Board
vacated its previous 2021 determinations that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms
headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. However, whether the PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily conduct inspections
of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainties and depends on a
number of factors out of our and our auditor&rsquo;s control. The PCAOB continues to demand complete access in mainland China and Hong
Kong moving forward and is making plans to resume regular inspections in early 2023 and beyond, as well as to continue pursuing ongoing
investigations and initiate new investigations as needed. The PCAOB has also indicated that it will act immediately to consider the need
to issue new determinations with the HFCAA if needed. Our auditor, MaloneBailey, LLP, is not among the PCAOB-registered public accounting
firms headquartered in China and Hong Kong that are subject to PCAOB&rsquo;s determination issued on December&nbsp;16, 2021 of having
been unable to inspect or investigate completely. However, we could still face the risk of delisting and cease of trading of our securities
from a stock exchange or an over-the-counter market in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and the securities
regulations promulgated thereunder if the PCAOB determines in the future that it is unable to completely inspect or investigate our auditor
which has a presence in China. These China-related risks could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities,
or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value
of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. In particular, recent policy statements and regulatory actions by the
PRC government, such as those related to the cryptocurrency mining business, may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business,
accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign stock exchange, which may cause the ADSs to be prohibited from trading
or to be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market or any other U.S. stock exchange. See &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks
Related to Conducting Business in China&rdquo; in our annual report on Form&nbsp;20-F for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2022 filed
with the SEC on April&nbsp;18, 2023 (the &ldquo;2022&nbsp;20-F&rdquo;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In particular, the PRC government has significant
oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene with or influence our operations as the government deems
appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals. The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly
affected certain industries, including the cryptocurrency industry, which may severely restrict our ability to expand our business or
serve our customers in China. We cannot assure you that government authorities in China will not introduce further enhanced regulation
over the cryptocurrency industry that may lead to our inability to operate in China at all. Furthermore, the PRC government has recently
indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities and foreign
investment in China-based companies like us. Any such action, once taken by the PRC government, could significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline
or in extreme cases, become worthless.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Investors in the ADSs are not purchasing equity
securities of our subsidiaries that have substantive business operations in China but instead are purchasing equity securities of a Cayman
Islands holding company. Nano Labs Ltd is a holding company with no material operations of its own. We conduct our operations primarily
through our subsidiaries in China and our subsidiaries in Hong Kong. Such structure involves unique risks to investors in the
ADSs. Investors may never directly hold equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries with substantive operations. We also cannot assure you
that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not disallow such a structure. If the Chinese regulatory authorities disallow the structure,
it would likely result in a material change in our operations and cause the value of the ADSs to significantly decline or become worthless.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Recently, the PRC government initiated a series
of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business operations in China with little advance notice,
including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas,
adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. The PRC government
also exerts more control over offerings conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers. In particular, on February&nbsp;17,
2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the &ldquo;CSRC&rdquo;) released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities
Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the &ldquo;Trial Measures&rdquo;), which came into effect on March&nbsp;31, 2023. The Trial
Measures apply to overseas securities offerings and/or listings conducted by (1)&nbsp;companies incorporated in the PRC, or PRC domestic
companies, directly and (2)&nbsp;companies incorporated overseas with operations primarily in the PRC and valued on the basis of interests
in PRC domestic companies, or indirect offerings. The Trial Measures requires (i)&nbsp;the filings of the overseas offering and listing
plan by the PRC domestic companies with the CSRC under certain conditions, and (ii)&nbsp;the filing of their underwriters or placement
agents with the CSRC under certain conditions and the submission of an annual report to the CSRC within the required timeline. On the
same day, the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by
Domestic Companies (the &ldquo;Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions&rdquo;) promulgated by the CSRC came into effect.
Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions stipulate that the PRC companies seeking overseas offerings and listings, either
directly or indirectly, as well as securities firms and securities service providers (both the PRC and overseas) involved in relevant
businesses, must not disclose any state secrets or confidential information of government agencies, nor harm national security and public
interests. Additionally, if a domestic company provides accounting archives or copies of such archives to any entities, including securities
firms, securities service providers, overseas regulators and individuals, it must comply with due procedures in accordance with applicable
regulations. We believe that offerings under this prospectus do not involve the disclosure of any state secret or confidential information
of government agencies, nor does it harm national security and public interests. However, we may need to perform additional procedures
concerning the provision of accounting archives. The specific requirements of these procedures are currently unclear, and we cannot guarantee
our ability to execute them. According to the Notice on the Administrative Arrangements for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering
and Listing by Domestic Enterprises (the &ldquo;Notice on Overseas Listing Measures&rdquo;) published by the CSRC on February 17, 2023,
issuers that had already been listed in an overseas market by March 31, 2023, the date the Trial Measures became effective, are not required
to make any immediate filing and are only required to comply with the filing requirements under the Trial Measures when it subsequently
seeks to conduct a follow-on offering. Therefore, we are required to go through filing procedures with the CSRC within three working
days after the completion of an offering made pursuant to this prospectus or any accompanying prospectus supplement and for our future
offerings of our securities in an overseas market, including Nasdaq, under the Trial Measures. Other than the CSRC filing procedure we
are required to make within three working days after the completion of an offering made pursuant to this prospectus or any accompanying
prospectus supplement, we and our PRC subsidiaries, as advised our PRC legal counsel, Zhong Lun Law Firm, (1) are not required to obtain
permissions from the CSRC, and (2) have not been required to obtain or denied such and other permissions by the CSRC, CAC, or any PRC
government authority, under current PRC laws, regulations and rules in connection with a potential offering made pursuant to this prospectus
or any accompanying prospectus supplement as of the date of this prospectus. See &rdquo; Risk Factors&mdash;Risks
Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;Recent regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review
or otherwise restrict or completely hinder our ability to offer securities and raise capitals overseas, all of which could materially
and adversely affect our business and cause the value of the ADSs to significantly decline or become worthless&rdquo; in the 2022 20-F.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The structure of cash flows within our organization,
and the applicable regulations, are as follows. After foreign investors&rsquo; funds enter Nano Labs Ltd, our holding company, at the
close of any offerings under this prospectus, subject to the cash demand of our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries, the funds can be transferred
to our wholly owned Cayman subsidiaries, then to our wholly owned BVI subsidiaries, then to our Hong Kong subsidiaries, which will further
distribute the funds to our PRC subsidiaries. If we intend to distribute dividends, PRC subsidiaries will transfer the dividends to our
Hong Kong subsidiaries in accordance with the laws and regulations of the PRC, and then our Hong Kong subsidiaries will transfer the
dividends all the way up to Nano Labs Ltd, and the dividends will be distributed from Nano Labs Ltd to all shareholders respectively
in proportion to the shares they hold, regardless of whether the shareholders are U.S. investors or investors in other countries or regions.
The cross-border transfer of funds within our corporate group under our direct holding structure must be legal and compliant with relevant
laws and regulations of China. In utilizing the proceeds from offerings under this prospectus, as an offshore holding company, we are
permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to
our affiliated entities only through loans, subject to applicable government reporting, registration and approvals. See &ldquo;Use of
Proceeds&rdquo; and &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factor&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;PRC
regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion
may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of offerings under this prospectus to make loans or additional capital contributions
to our PRC subsidiaries and affiliated entities&rdquo; in the 2022 20-F. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, we transferred cash proceeds of nil,
US$21.1&nbsp;million and US$24.3&nbsp;million to our PRC subsidiaries for the settlement of intercompany transactions and as paid-in
capital for our PRC subsidiaries, and none of our PRC subsidiaries has issued any dividends or distributions to respective holding companies
or any investors as of the date of this prospectus. We do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares
in the foreseeable future after any offerings under this prospectus. We have, from time to time, transferred cash between our PRC subsidiaries
to fund their operations, and we do not anticipate any difficulties or limitations on our ability to transfer cash between such subsidiaries.
As of the date of this prospectus, no cash generated from our PRC subsidiaries has been used to fund operations of any of our non-PRC
subsidiaries. We may encounter difficulties in our ability to transfer cash between PRC subsidiaries and non-PRC subsidiaries largely
due to various PRC laws and regulations imposed on foreign exchange. However, as long as we are compliant with the procedures for approvals
from foreign exchange authorities and banks in China, the relevant laws and regulations in China do not impose limitations on the amount
of funds that we can transfer out of China. We currently do not have any cash management policy that dictate the transfer of cash between
our subsidiaries. See &ldquo;Item 4. Information of the Company&mdash;B. Business Overview&mdash;Regulation&mdash;PRC Laws and Regulations
relating to Foreign Exchange&rdquo; in the 2022 20-F for details of such procedures.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The General Office of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severe and Lawful Crackdown on
Illegal Securities Activities, which was available to the public on July&nbsp;6, 2021. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen
the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies. These opinions
proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents
facing China-based overseas-listed companies and the demand for cybersecurity and data privacy protection. Moreover, on January&nbsp;4,
2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China, or the CAC, and other ministries and commissions (including the CSRC), announced the adoption
of the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective on February&nbsp;15, 2022 and provides that network platform operators possessing
personal information of more than one million individual users must undergo a cybersecurity review by the CAC when they seek to have
their securities listed on a foreign stock exchange. Furthermore, the Standing Committee of the National People&rsquo;s Congress passed
the Personal Information Protection Law of the PRC, or PIPL, which became effective on November&nbsp;1, 2021, requires such operators
to obtain consent of the user prior to any cross-border transfer of personal information, as well as the satisfaction of at least one
of the following conditions: (1)&nbsp;a security assessment organized by competent cybersecurity authorities has been passed; (2)&nbsp;certification
of personal information protection from a specialized institution in accordance with the provisions issued by competent cybersecurity
authorities has been passed; (3)&nbsp;a model standard contract about both parties&rsquo; rights and obligations formulated by competent
cybersecurity authorities with the overseas recipient has been entered into; or (4)&nbsp;any other condition prescribed by laws, administrative
regulations or by competent cybersecurity authorities has been satisfied. These policies and any related implementation rules to be enacted
may subject us to additional compliance requirement. As of the date of this prospectus, no official guidance or related implementation
rules have been issued in relation to these recently issued opinions, and the interpretation and implementation of these opinions remain
unclear at this stage. Moreover, the M&amp;A Rules requires an overseas special purpose vehicle that are controlled by PRC companies
or individuals formed for the purpose of seeking a public listing on an overseas stock exchange through acquisitions of PRC domestic
companies using shares of such special purpose vehicle or held by its shareholders as considerations to obtain the approval of the CSRC,
prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle&rsquo;s securities on an overseas stock exchange. However, the application
of the M&amp;A Rules remains unclear.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Recently, the PRC government initiated a series
of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business operations in China with little advance notice,
including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas,
adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. The PRC government
also exerts more control over offerings conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers. In particular, on February&nbsp;17,
2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the &ldquo;CSRC&rdquo;) released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities
Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the &ldquo;Trial Measures&rdquo;), which came into effect on March&nbsp;31, 2023. The Trial
Measures apply to overseas securities offerings and/or listings conducted by (1)&nbsp;companies incorporated in the PRC, or PRC domestic
companies, directly and (2)&nbsp;companies incorporated overseas with operations primarily in the PRC and valued on the basis of interests
in PRC domestic companies, or indirect offerings. The Trial Measures requires (i)&nbsp;the filings of the overseas offering and listing
plan by the PRC domestic companies with the CSRC under certain conditions, and (ii)&nbsp;the filing of their underwriters or placement
agents with the CSRC under certain conditions and the submission of an annual report to the CSRC within the required timeline. On the
same day, the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by
Domestic Companies (the &ldquo;Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions&rdquo;) promulgated by the CSRC came into effect.
Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions stipulate that the PRC companies seeking overseas offerings and listings, either
directly or indirectly, as well as securities firms and securities service providers (both the PRC and overseas) involved in relevant
businesses, must not disclose any state secrets or confidential information of government agencies, nor harm national security and public
interests. Additionally, if a domestic company provides accounting archives or copies of such archives to any entities, including securities
firms, securities service providers, overseas regulators and individuals, it must comply with due procedures in accordance with applicable
regulations. We believe that offerings under this prospectus or any accompanying prospectus supplement do not involve the disclosure
of any state secret or confidential information of government agencies, nor does it harm national security and public interests. However,
we may need to perform additional procedures concerning the provision of accounting archives. The specific requirements of these procedures
are currently unclear, and we cannot guarantee our ability to execute them. According to the Notice on the Administrative Arrangements
for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Enterprises (the &ldquo;Notice on Overseas Listing Measures&rdquo;)
published by the CSRC on February 17, 2023, issuers that had already been listed in an overseas market by March 31, 2023, the date the

operations of its own. We conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong. As a result, Nano Labs Ltd&rsquo;s
ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong. If our existing PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries
or any newly formed ones incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability
to pay dividends to us.</P>

to pay dividends to us only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.
Pursuant to the Company Law of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, or the PRC Company Law, our PRC subsidiaries are required to make
contribution of at least 10% of their after-tax profits calculated in accordance with the PRC GAAP to the statutory common reserve. Contribution
is not required if the reserve fund has reached 50% of the registered capital of our subsidiaries. As of December&nbsp;31, 2022, our
PRC subsidiaries had restricted amount of RMB6.6&nbsp;million (US$0.9 million) the reserve fund.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">None of our PRC subsidiaries has issued any dividends
or distributions to respective holding companies or any investors as of the date of this prospectus. Our PRC subsidiaries generate and
retain cash generated from operating activities and re-invest it in our business. Historically, our PRC subsidiaries have also received
equity financing from its shareholders to fund business operations of our PRC subsidiaries. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, we transferred cash
proceeds of nil, US$21.1&nbsp;million and US$24.3&nbsp;million to our PRC subsidiaries for the settlement of intercompany transactions
and as paid-in capital for our PRC subsidiaries. In the future, cash proceeds raised from overseas financing activities may be, and are
intended to be, transferred by us through subsidiaries in Hong Kong to our PRC subsidiaries via capital contribution and shareholder
loans, as the case may be. Subsidiaries in China that receives such cash proceeds then will transfer funds to its subsidiaries to meet
the capital needs of our business operations. For details about the applicable PRC rules that limit transfer of funds from overseas to
our PRC subsidiaries, see &ldquo;Use of Proceeds&rdquo; and &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The structure of cash flows within our organization,
and the applicable regulations, are as follows. After foreign investors&rsquo; funds enter Nano Labs Ltd, our holding company, at the
close of any offerings under this prospectus, subject to the cash demand of our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries, the funds can be transferred
to our wholly owned Cayman subsidiaries, then to our wholly owned BVI subsidiaries, then to our Hong Kong subsidiaries, which will further
distribute the funds to our PRC subsidiaries. If we intend to distribute dividends, PRC subsidiaries will transfer the dividends to our
Hong Kong subsidiaries in accordance with the laws and regulations of the PRC, and then our Hong Kong subsidiaries will transfer the
dividends all the way up to Nano Labs Ltd, and the dividends will be distributed from Nano Labs Ltd to all shareholders respectively
in proportion to the shares they hold, regardless of whether the shareholders are U.S. investors or investors in other countries or regions.
The cross-border transfer of funds within our corporate group under our direct holding structure must be legal and compliant with relevant
laws and regulations of China. In utilizing the proceeds from offerings under this prospectus, as an offshore holding company, we are
permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to
our affiliated entities only through loans, subject to applicable government reporting, registration and approvals. See &ldquo;Use of
Proceeds&rdquo; and &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factor&mdash;Risks Related to Conducting Business in China&mdash;PRC

may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of offerings under this prospectus to make loans or additional capital contributions
to our PRC subsidiaries and affiliated entities&rdquo; in the 2022 20-F. We do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on
our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future after any offerings under this prospectus. We have, from time to time, transferred cash
between our PRC subsidiaries to fund their operations, and we do not anticipate any difficulties or limitations on our ability to transfer
cash between such subsidiaries. As of the date of this prospectus, no cash generated from our PRC subsidiaries has been used to fund
operations of any of our non-PRC subsidiaries. We may encounter difficulties in our ability to transfer cash between PRC subsidiaries
and non-PRC subsidiaries largely due to various PRC laws and regulations imposed on foreign exchange. However, as long as we are compliant
with the procedures for approvals from foreign exchange authorities and banks in China, the relevant laws and regulations in China do
not impose limitations on the amount of funds that we can transfer out of China. We currently do not have any cash management policy
that dictate the transfer of cash between our subsidiaries. See &ldquo;Item 4. Information of the Company&mdash;B. Business Overview&mdash;Regulation&mdash;PRC
Laws and Regulations relating to Foreign Exchange&rdquo; in the 2022 20-F for details of such procedures.</P>

in revenue for the last fiscal year, we qualify as an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups

applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under Section&nbsp;404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Under the JOBS Act, an emerging
growth company does not need to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards until the date that private companies are
required to do so. We have elected to take advantage of such exemption, and as a result, while we are an emerging growth company, we
will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time that they become applicable to other public companies that
are not emerging growth companies.</P>

    memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision
    may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud
    or the consequences of committing a crime. Our memorandum and articles of association provide that we shall indemnify our directors
    and officers (but not our auditors) against all actions, proceedings, costs, charges, expenses, losses, damages or liabilities incurred
    or sustained by each such indemnified person, other than by reason of their own dishonesty, willful default or fraud, in or about
    the conduct of our company&rsquo;s business or affairs (including as a result of any mistake of judgment) or in the execution or
    discharge of their duties, powers, authorities or discretions, including any costs, expenses, losses or liabilities incurred by them
    in defending any civil proceedings concerning our company or its affairs in any court whether in the Cayman Islands or elsewhere.
    This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.</FONT></TD>

    reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct would be unlawful, against amounts actually and reasonably incurred. Additionally,
    under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a Delaware corporation must indemnify its present or former directors and officers against
    expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) actually and reasonably incurred to the extent that the officer or director has been successful

    <TD STYLE="vertical-align: bottom">&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD STYLE="vertical-align: top"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company
    is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he owes the following duties to
    the company: a duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a personal profit based on his
    position as director (unless the company permits him to do so), a duty not to put himself in a position where the interests of the
    company conflict with his personal interest or his duty to a third party and a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for which
    such powers were intended. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously
    considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected
    from a person of his knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard
    with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.</FONT></TD>
    <TD STYLE="vertical-align: bottom">&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD STYLE="vertical-align: top"><P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation
    has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty.
    The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under
    similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information
    reasonably available regarding a significant transaction.</P>
    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>
    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The duty of loyalty requires that a director acts in a manner
    he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He or she must not use his corporate position for personal
    gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its
    shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the
    shareholders generally.</P>
    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>
    <P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made
    on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation.
    However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented
    concerning a transaction by a director, the director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the transaction
    was of fair value to the corporation.</P></TD></TR>

OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Citibank, N.A. is the depositary for the ADSs.
Citibank&rsquo;s depositary offices are located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013. American Depositary Shares are frequently
referred to as &ldquo;ADSs&rdquo; and represent ownership interests in securities that are on deposit with the depositary. ADSs may be&nbsp;represented
by certificates that are commonly known as &ldquo;American Depositary Receipts&rdquo; or &ldquo;ADRs.&rdquo; The depositary typically
appoints a custodian to safekeep the securities on deposit. In this case, the custodian is Citibank, N.A.&mdash;Hong Kong, located at
9/F Citi Tower, One Bay East, 83 Hoi Bun Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We have appointed Citibank as depositary pursuant
to a deposit agreement. A copy of the deposit agreement is on file with the SEC under cover of a Registration Statement on Form F-6.
You may obtain a copy of the deposit agreement from the SEC&rsquo;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549
and from the SEC&rsquo;s website (<U>www.sec.gov</U>). Please refer to Registration Number 333-265862 when retrieving such copy.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We are providing you with a summary description
of the material terms of the ADSs and of your material rights as an owner of ADSs. Please remember that summaries by their nature lack
the precision of the information summarized and that the rights and obligations of an owner of ADSs will be determined by reference to
the terms of the deposit agreement and not by this summary. We urge you to review the deposit agreement in its entirety. The portions
of this summary description that are italicized describe matters that may be relevant to the ownership of ADSs but that may not be contained
in the deposit agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Each ADS represents the right to receive, and
to exercise the beneficial ownership interests in, two Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares that are on deposit with the depositary and/or custodian.
An ADS also represents the right to receive, and to exercise the beneficial interests in, any other property received by the depositary
or the custodian on behalf of the owner of the ADS but that has not been distributed to the owners of ADSs because of legal restrictions
or practical considerations. We and the depositary may agree to change the ADS-to-Share ratio by amending the deposit agreement. This
amendment may give rise to, or change, the depositary fees payable by ADS owners. The custodian, the depositary and their respective
nominees will hold all deposited property for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of ADSs. The deposited property does not
constitute the proprietary assets of the depositary, the custodian or their nominees. Beneficial ownership in the deposited property
will under the terms of the deposit agreement be vested in the beneficial owners of the ADSs. The depositary, the custodian and their
respective nominees will be the record holders of the deposited property represented by the ADSs for the benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the corresponding ADSs. A beneficial owner of ADSs may or may not be the holder of ADSs. Beneficial owners of ADSs will be
able to receive, and to exercise beneficial ownership interests in, the deposited property only through the registered holders of the
ADSs, the registered holders of the ADSs (on behalf of the applicable ADS owners) only through the depositary, and the depositary (on
behalf of the owners of the corresponding ADSs) directly, or indirectly, through the custodian or their respective nominees, in each
case upon the terms of the deposit agreement.<B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">If you become an owner of ADSs, you will become
a party to the deposit agreement and therefore will be bound to its terms and to the terms of any ADR that represents your ADSs. The
deposit agreement and the ADR specify our rights and obligations as well as your rights and obligations as an owner of ADSs and those
of the depositary. As an ADS holder you appoint the depositary to act on your behalf in certain circumstances. The deposit agreement
and the ADRs are governed by New York law. However, our obligations to the holders of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will continue to be
governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, which may be different from the laws in the United States.</P>

require you to satisfy reporting requirements and obtain regulatory approvals in certain circumstances. You are solely responsible for
complying with such reporting requirements and obtaining such approvals. Neither the depositary, the custodian, us or any of their or
our respective agents or affiliates shall be required to take any actions whatsoever on your behalf to satisfy such reporting requirements
or obtain such regulatory approvals under applicable laws and regulations.</P>

as one of our shareholders and you will not have direct shareholder rights. The depositary will hold on your behalf the shareholder rights
attached to the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. As an owner of ADSs you will be able to exercise the shareholders
rights for the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares represented by your ADSs through the depositary only to the extent contemplated in the deposit
agreement. To exercise any shareholder rights not contemplated in the deposit agreement you will, as an ADS owner, need to arrange for
the cancelation of your ADSs and become a direct shareholder.</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The manner in which you own the ADSs (e.g., in
a brokerage account vs. as registered holder, or as holder of certificated vs. uncertificated ADSs) may affect your rights and obligations,
and the manner in which, and extent to which, the depositary&rsquo;s services are made available to you. As an owner of ADSs, you may
hold your ADSs either by means of an ADR registered in your name, through a brokerage or safekeeping account, or through an account established
by the depositary in your name reflecting the registration of uncertificated ADSs directly on the books of the depositary (commonly referred
to as the &ldquo;direct registration system&rdquo; or &ldquo;DRS&rdquo;). The direct registration system reflects the uncertificated
(book-entry) registration of ownership of ADSs by the depositary. Under the direct registration system, ownership of ADSs is evidenced
by periodic statements issued by the depositary to the holders of the ADSs. The direct registration system includes automated transfers
between the depositary and The Depository Trust Company (&ldquo;DTC&rdquo;), the central book-entry clearing and settlement system for
equity securities in the United States. If you decide to hold your ADSs through your brokerage or safekeeping account, you must rely
on the procedures of your broker or bank to assert your rights as ADS owner. Banks and brokers typically hold securities such as the
ADSs through clearing and settlement systems such as DTC. The procedures of such clearing and settlement systems may limit your ability
to exercise your rights as an owner of ADSs. Please consult with your broker or bank if you have any questions concerning these limitations
and procedures. All ADSs held through DTC will be registered in the name of a nominee of DTC, which nominee will be the only &ldquo;holder&rdquo;
of such ADSs for purposes of the deposit agreement and any applicable ADR. This summary description assumes you have opted to own the
ADSs directly by means of an ADS registered in your name and, as such, we will refer to you as the &ldquo;holder.&rdquo; When we refer
to &ldquo;you,&rdquo; we assume the reader owns ADSs and will own ADSs at the relevant time.</P>

in such Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares being at all times vested with the beneficial owners of the ADSs representing the Class&nbsp;A ordinary

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In connection with an offering, an underwriter
may purchase and sell securities in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases
to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of securities than they
are required to purchase in the offering. &ldquo;Covered&rdquo; short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters&rsquo;
option to purchase additional securities, if any, from us in the offering. If the underwriters have an over-allotment option to purchase
additional securities from us, the underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their over-allotment option
or purchasing securities in the open market. In determining the source of securities to close out the covered short position, the underwriters
may consider, among other things, the price of securities available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which
they may purchase securities through the over-allotment option. &ldquo;Naked&rdquo; short sales are any sales in excess of such option
or where the underwriters do not have an over-allotment option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing
securities in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be

or to otherwise stabilize or maintain the price of the securities, the underwriters may bid for or purchase securities in the open market
and may impose penalty bids. If penalty bids are imposed, selling concessions allowed to syndicate members or other broker-dealers participating
in the offering are reclaimed if securities previously distributed in the offering are repurchased, whether in connection with stabilization
transactions or otherwise. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level
above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. The impositions of a penalty bid may also affect the price of the securities
to the extent that it discourages resale of the securities. The magnitude or effect of any stabilization or other transactions is uncertain.
These transactions may be effected on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.</P>

the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and
enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Zhong Lun Law Firm has advised us further
that under PRC law, a foreign judgment that does not otherwise violate the basic legal principles, national sovereignty, security or
public interest may be recognized and enforced by a PRC court, based either on bilateral treaties or international conventions contracted
by China and the jurisdiction where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any
treaties or other form of reciprocity with the United States or the Cayman Islands that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of foreign judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in China will not enforce a foreign judgment against
us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security
or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in
the United States or in the Cayman Islands. Under the PRC Civil Procedures Law, foreign shareholders may originate actions based on PRC
law against us in China if they can establish sufficient connection to China for a PRC court to have jurisdiction, and meet other procedural
requirements, including, among others, the plaintiff must have a direct interest in the case, and there must be a concrete claim, a factual
basis and a cause for the suit. However, it will be difficult for foreign shareholders, by virtue only of holding the ADSs or ordinary
shares, to establish a sufficient connection to China for a PRC court to have jurisdiction as required under the PRC Civil Procedures
Law.</P>
