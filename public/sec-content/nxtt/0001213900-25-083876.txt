<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our counsel as to PRC law has advised us that
the laws and regulations of the PRC do not currently have any material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
However, there is no assurance that there will not be any changes in the economic, political and legal environment in Hong Kong in the
future. If there is a significant change to current political arrangements between mainland China and Hong Kong, companies operating in
Hong Kong such as us may face similar regulatory risks as those operated in the PRC, including their ability to offer securities to investors,
list their securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct their business or accept foreign investment. In light of China&rsquo;s
recent expansion of authority in Hong Kong, there are risks and uncertainties which we cannot foresee for the time being, and rules and
regulations in China can change quickly with little or no advance notice. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our current
and future operations in Hong Kong at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment
in issuers like ourselves.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We are aware that the PRC government initiated
a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in certain areas in China with little advance notice, including
cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable
interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly
enforcement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On December 28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration
of China (the &ldquo;CAC&rdquo;) jointly with the relevant authorities formally published Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) which
took effect on February 15, 2022, replacing the former Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2020) issued on July 10, 2021. Measures for
Cybersecurity Review (2021) stipulates that operators of critical information infrastructure purchasing network products and services,
and online platform operators (together with the operators of critical information infrastructure, the &ldquo;Operators&rdquo;) carrying
out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review, and any online platform
operator who controls more than one million users&rsquo; personal information must undergo a cybersecurity review by the cybersecurity
review office if it seeks to be listed in a foreign country.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On February 17, 2023, with the approval of the
State Council, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the &ldquo;CSRC&rdquo;) promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas
Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect on
March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, (i) domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and
indirectly, shall complete filing procedures with the CSRC pursuant to the requirements of the Trial Measures within three working days
following their submission of initial public offerings or listing applications. If a domestic company fails to complete the required filing
procedures or conceals any material fact or falsifies any major content in its filing documents, such domestic company may be subject
to administrative penalties, such as an order to rectify, warnings and fines, and its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, the
person directly in charge and other directly liable persons may also be subject to administrative penalties, such as warnings and fines;
(ii) if the issuer meets both of the following criteria, the overseas offering and listing conducted by such issuer shall be deemed an
indirect overseas offering and listing by a PRC domestic company: (A) 50% or more of any of the issuer&rsquo;s operating revenue, total
profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year were
derived from PRC domestic companies; and (B) the majority of the issuer&rsquo;s business activities are carried out in mainland China,
or its main place(s) of business are located in mainland China, or the majority of its senior management team in charge of its business
operations and management are PRC citizens or have their usual place(s) of residence located in mainland China. In such circumstances,
where a PRC domestic company is seeking an indirect overseas offering and listing in an overseas market, the issuer shall designate a
major domestic operating entity responsible for all filing procedures with the CSRC, and where an issuer makes an application for an initial
public offering or listing in an overseas market, the issuer shall submit filings with the CSRC within three business days after such
application is submitted.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On February 24, 2023, the CSRC, together with
the MOF, National Administration of State Secrets Protection and National Archives Administration of China, revised the Provisions issued
by the CSRC and National Administration of State Secrets Protection and National Archives Administration of China in 2009. The revised
Provisions were issued under the title the &ldquo;Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas
Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies,&rdquo; and became effective on March 31, 2023 together with the Trial Measures.
One of the major revisions to the revised Provisions is to expand their application to cover indirect overseas offering and listing, as
is consistent with the Trial Measures. The revised Provisions require that, among other things, (a) a domestic company that plans to,
either directly or indirectly through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant individuals or entities, including
securities companies, securities service providers, and overseas regulators, any documents and materials that contain state secrets or
working secrets of government agencies, shall first obtain approval from competent authorities according to law, and file with the secrecy
administrative department at the same level; and (b) a domestic company that plans to, either directly or indirectly through its overseas
listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant individuals and entities, including securities companies, securities service providers,
and overseas regulators, any other documents and materials that, if leaked, will be detrimental to national security or public interest,
shall strictly fulfill relevant procedures stipulated by applicable national regulations. As of the date of this Report, the revised Provisions
have come into effect. Any failure or perceived failure by our Company or our subsidiaries to comply with the above confidentiality and
archives administration requirements under the revised Provisions and other PRC laws and regulations may result in the relevant entities
being held legally liable by competent authorities, and referred to the judicial organ to be investigated for criminal liability if suspected
of committing a crime.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Except for the Basic Law, national laws of the
PRC do not apply in Hong Kong unless they are listed in Annex III of the Basic Law and applied locally by promulgation or local legislation.
National laws that may be listed in Annex III are currently limited under the Basic Law to those which fall within the scope of defense
and foreign affairs as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of Hong Kong. National laws and regulations relating to
data protection, cybersecurity and anti-monopoly have not been listed in Annex III and do not apply directly to Hong Kong and, as such,
we are advised by our counsel as to PRC law that the CAC and CSRC do not currently have jurisdiction over companies operating in Hong
Kong.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our counsel as to PRC law has advised us that
we are not currently required to obtain any permission or approval from the CSRC, the CAC or any other regulatory authority in the PRC
for our operations, the trading of our securities on the Nasdaq and the offering of our securities to foreign investors. The business
of our subsidiary is not subject to cybersecurity review with the CAC, given that PRC laws on data protection and cybersecurity do not
currently apply to Hong Kong. To the extent that if we become subject to such PRC laws in the future, we do not believe we are required
to conduct a cybersecurity review because (i) we do not possess a large amount of personal information in our business operations; and
(ii) data processed in our business does not have a bearing on national security and thus may not be classified as core or important data
by the authorities. In addition, we are not subject to merger control review by China&rsquo;s anti-monopoly enforcement agency as such
PRC enforcement agency does not currently have jurisdiction over our Hong Kong operating subsidiary. However, our operations could be
adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to our business or industry, if we inadvertently
conclude that such approvals are not required when they are, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required
to obtain approval in the future. We may be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC,
if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which could adversely affect the ability of the Company&rsquo;s securities to continue
to trade on the Nasdaq, which may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition, in light of the recent statements
and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to Hong Kong&rsquo;s national security, the promulgation of regulations
prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns,
we may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard including the risk that the PRC
government could disallow our holding company structure, which may result in a material change in our operations, including our ability
to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to
offer securities to our investors. These adverse actions could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">There may be prominent risks associated with our
operations being in Hong Kong. For example, as a U.S.-listed public company operating primarily in Hong Kong, we may face heightened scrutiny,
criticism and negative publicity, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock. Additionally,
we are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with our business operations in Hong Kong, which is subject to political
and economic influence from China. PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain,
and we may face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be
able to conduct in Hong Kong and the profitability of such business. Therefore, these risks associated with being based in or having the
majority of our operations in Hong Kong could likely cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Furthermore,
these risks would likely result in a material change in our business operations or a complete hinderance of our ability to offer or continue
to offer our securities to investors. Furthermore, changes in Chinese internal regulatory mandates, such as the Regulations on Mergers
and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the &ldquo;M&amp;A Rules&rdquo;), the Anti-Monopoly Law, the Cybersecurity
Law and the Data Security Law, may target the Company&rsquo;s corporate structure and impact our ability to conduct business in Hong Kong,
accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act, or the HFCAA, if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, is unable to inspect an issuer&rsquo;s auditors for
three consecutive&nbsp;years, the issuer&rsquo;s securities are prohibited to trade on a U.S.&nbsp;stock exchange. The PCAOB issued a
Determination Report on December&nbsp;16, 2021 which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public
accounting firms headquartered in: (1)&nbsp;mainland China of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China because of a position taken by one
or more authorities in mainland China; and (2)&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because
of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong&nbsp;Kong. Furthermore, the PCAOB&rsquo;s report identified the specific registered
public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations. On June&nbsp;22, 2021, the U.S.&nbsp;Senate passed the Accelerating
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, and on December&nbsp;29, 2022, legislation entitled &ldquo;Consolidated Appropriations Act,
2023&rdquo; (the &ldquo;Consolidated Appropriations Act&rdquo;) was signed into law by former President Biden, which contained, among
other things, an identical provision to the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and amended the HFCAA by requiring
the SEC to prohibit an issuer&rsquo;s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections
for two consecutive&nbsp;years instead of three, thus reducing the time period for triggering the prohibition on trading. On August&nbsp;26,
2022, the PCAOB announced that it had signed a Statement of Protocol (the &ldquo;SOP&rdquo;) with the China Securities Regulatory Commission
and the Ministry of Finance of China. The SOP, together with two protocol agreements governing inspections and investigations (together,
the &ldquo;SOP Agreement&rdquo;), establishes a specific, accountable framework to make possible complete inspections and investigations
by the PCAOB of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong, as required under U.S.&nbsp;law. On December&nbsp;15, 2022, the
PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered
in mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong completely in 2022. The PCAOB Board vacated its previous 2021 determinations that the PCAOB was unable
to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong. However, whether
the PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in
mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong is subject to uncertainties and depends on a number of factors out of our and our auditor&rsquo;s control.
The PCAOB continues to demand complete access in mainland China and Hong&nbsp;Kong and pursue ongoing investigations and initiate new
investigations as needed. The PCAOB has also indicated that it will act immediately to consider the need to issue new determinations with
the HFCAA if needed.&nbsp;</P>

forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;),
and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking
statements contained in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical
facts, included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus regarding our strategy, future
operations, financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, including, without limitation,
the discussion of whether and when potential acquisition transactions will close, expectations concerning our ability to increase our
revenue, expectations with respect to operational efficiency, expectations regarding financing, and expectations concerning our business
strategy, under &ldquo;Prospectus Supplement Summary - Recent Developments,&rdquo; are forward-looking statements. The words &ldquo;anticipates,&rdquo;

&ldquo;projects,&rdquo; &ldquo;will,&rdquo; &ldquo;would&rdquo; and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements,
although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. We cannot guarantee that we actually will achieve the plans,
intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking
statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these
forward-looking statements. These important factors include the factors that we identify in the documents we incorporate by reference

support teams; marketing and prospecting effectiveness; the ability to incorporate artificial intelligence and other technically advanced
features; and our ability to differentiate our products. Failure to perform in these or other areas may reduce the demand for our offerings
and materially adversely affect our revenue from both existing and prospective customers.</P>

accounts at Japanese based, institutional-grade custodians that have demonstrated records of regulatory compliance and information security.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our counsel as to PRC law has advised us that
the laws and regulations of the PRC do not currently have any material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
However, there is no assurance that there will not be any changes in the economic, political and legal environment in Hong Kong in the
future. If there is a significant change to current political arrangements between mainland China and Hong Kong, companies operating in
Hong Kong such as us may face similar regulatory risks as those operated in the PRC, including their ability to offer securities to investors,
list their securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct their business or accept foreign investment. In light of China&rsquo;s
recent expansion of authority in Hong Kong, there are risks and uncertainties which we cannot foresee for the time being, and rules and
regulations in China can change quickly with little or no advance notice. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our current
and future operations in Hong Kong at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment
in issuers like ourselves.</P>

a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in certain areas in China with little advance notice, including
cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable

in the securities markets and promote the high-quality development of the capital markets, which, among other things, requires the relevant
governmental authorities to strengthen cross-border oversight of law-enforcement and judicial cooperation, to enhance supervision over
Chinese-based companies listed overseas, and to establish and improve the system of extraterritorial application of the PRC securities

natural persons within the territory of China that is carried out outside of China where (i) such processing is for the purpose of providing
products or services for natural persons within China, (ii) such processing is to analyze or evaluate the behavior of natural persons
within China, or (iii) there are any other circumstances stipulated by related laws and administrative regulations.</P>

Operators carrying out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review, and
any online platform operator who controls more than one million users&rsquo; personal information must undergo a cybersecurity review
by the cybersecurity review office if it seeks to be listed in a foreign country.</P>

State Council, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the &ldquo;CSRC&rdquo;) promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas
Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect on
March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, (i) domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and
indirectly, shall complete filing procedures with the CSRC pursuant to the requirements of the Trial Measures within three working days
following their submission of initial public offerings or listing applications. If a domestic company fails to complete the required filing
procedures or conceals any material fact or falsifies any major content in its filing documents, such domestic company may be subject
to administrative penalties, such as an order to rectify, warnings and fines, and its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, the
person directly in charge and other directly liable persons may also be subject to administrative penalties, such as warnings and fines;
(ii) if the issuer meets both of the following criteria, the overseas offering and listing conducted by such issuer shall be deemed an
indirect overseas offering and listing by a PRC domestic company: (A) 50% or more of any of the issuer&rsquo;s operating revenue, total
profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year were
derived from PRC domestic companies; and (B) the majority of the issuer&rsquo;s business activities are carried out in mainland China,
or its main place(s) of business are located in mainland China, or the majority of its senior management team in charge of its business
operations and management are PRC citizens or have their usual place(s) of residence located in mainland China. In such circumstances,
where a PRC domestic company is seeking an indirect overseas offering and listing in an overseas market, the issuer shall designate a
major domestic operating entity responsible for all filing procedures with the CSRC, and where an issuer makes an application for an initial
public offering or listing in an overseas market, the issuer shall submit filings with the CSRC within three business days after such
application is submitted.</P>

the MOF, National Administration of State Secrets Protection and National Archives Administration of China, revised the Provisions issued
by the CSRC and National Administration of State Secrets Protection and National Archives Administration of China in 2009. The revised
Provisions were issued under the title the &ldquo;Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas
Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies,&rdquo; and became effective on March 31, 2023 together with the Trial Measures.
One of the major revisions to the revised Provisions is to expand their application to cover indirect overseas offering and listing, as
is consistent with the Trial Measures. The revised Provisions require that, among other things, (a) a domestic company that plans to,
either directly or indirectly through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant individuals or entities, including
securities companies, securities service providers, and overseas regulators, any documents and materials that contain state secrets or
working secrets of government agencies, shall first obtain approval from competent authorities according to law, and file with the secrecy
administrative department at the same level; and (b) a domestic company that plans to, either directly or indirectly through its overseas
listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant individuals and entities, including securities companies, securities service providers,
and overseas regulators, any other documents and materials that, if leaked, will be detrimental to national security or public interest,
shall strictly fulfill relevant procedures stipulated by applicable national regulations. As of the date of this Report, the revised Provisions
have come into effect. Any failure or perceived failure by our Company or our subsidiaries to comply with the above confidentiality and
archives administration requirements under the revised Provisions and other PRC laws and regulations may result in the relevant entities
being held legally liable by competent authorities, and referred to the judicial organ to be investigated for criminal liability if suspected
of committing a crime.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Except for the Basic Law, national laws of the
PRC do not apply in Hong Kong unless they are listed in Annex III of the Basic Law and applied locally by promulgation or local legislation.
National laws that may be listed in Annex III are currently limited under the Basic Law to those which fall within the scope of defense
and foreign affairs as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of Hong Kong. National laws and regulations relating to
data protection, cybersecurity and anti-monopoly have not been listed in Annex III and do not apply directly to Hong Kong and, as such,
we are advised by our counsel as to PRC law that the CAC and CSRC do not currently have jurisdiction over companies operating in Hong
Kong.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our counsel as to PRC law has advised us that
we are not currently required to obtain any permission or approval from the CSRC, the CAC or any other regulatory authority in the PRC
for our operations, the trading of our securities on the Nasdaq and the offering of our securities to foreign investors. The business
of our subsidiary is not subject to cybersecurity review with the CAC, given that PRC laws on data protection and cybersecurity do not
currently apply to Hong Kong. To the extent that if we become subject to such PRC laws in the future, we do not believe we are required
to conduct a cybersecurity review because (i) we do not possess a large amount of personal information in our business operations; and
(ii) data processed in our business does not have a bearing on national security and thus may not be classified as core or important data
by the authorities. In addition, we are not subject to merger control review by China&rsquo;s anti-monopoly enforcement agency as such
PRC enforcement agency does not currently have jurisdiction over our Hong Kong operating subsidiary. However, our operations could be
adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to our business or industry, if we inadvertently
conclude that such approvals are not required when they are, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required
to obtain approval in the future. We may be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC,
if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which could adversely affect the ability of the Company&rsquo;s securities to continue
to trade on the Nasdaq, which may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition, in light of the recent statements
and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to Hong Kong&rsquo;s national security, the promulgation of regulations
prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns,
we may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard including the risk that the PRC
government could disallow our holding company structure, which may result in a material change in our operations, including our ability
to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to
offer securities to our investors. These adverse actions could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">There may be prominent risks associated with our
operations being in Hong Kong. For example, as a U.S.-listed public company operating primarily in Hong Kong, we may face heightened scrutiny,
criticism and negative publicity, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock. Additionally,
we are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with our business operations in Hong Kong, which is subject to political
and economic influence from China. PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain,
and we may face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be
able to conduct in Hong Kong and the profitability of such business. Therefore, these risks associated with being based in or having the
majority of our operations in Hong Kong could likely cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Furthermore,
these risks would likely result in a material change in our business operations or a complete hinderance of our ability to offer or continue
to offer our securities to investors. Furthermore, changes in Chinese internal regulatory mandates, such as the Regulations on Mergers
and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the &ldquo;M&amp;A Rules&rdquo;), the Anti-Monopoly Law, the Cybersecurity
Law and the Data Security Law, may target the Company&rsquo;s corporate structure and impact our ability to conduct business in Hong Kong,
accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The U.S. government, including the SEC, has recently
made statements and taken certain actions that may lead to significant changes to U.S. and international relations, and will impact companies
with connections to the United States or China (including Hong Kong). The SEC has issued statements primarily focused on companies with
significant China-based operations. For example, on July 30, 2021, Gary Gensler, Chairman of the SEC, issued a Statement on Investor Protection
Related to Recent Developments in China, pursuant to which Chairman Gensler stated that he has asked the SEC staff to engage in targeted
additional reviews of filings for companies with significant China-based operations.</P>

Act</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final
rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. An identified issuer will be required
to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a &ldquo;non-inspection&rdquo; year under a process to be subsequently established
by the SEC. In June 2021, the Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if signed into law, would
reduce the time period for the delisting of foreign companies under the HFCAA to two consecutive years instead of three years. If our
auditor cannot be inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, for two consecutive years, the trading of
our securities on any U.S. national securities exchanges, as well as any over-the-counter trading in the U.S., will be prohibited. On
September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the HFCAA, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining,
as contemplated under the HFCAA, whether the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located
in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued
amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The rules apply to registrants that
the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located
in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in
foreign jurisdictions. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that it is unable to inspect or investigate
completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, because of positions taken by PRC
authorities in those jurisdictions. On August 26, 2022, the&nbsp;PCAOB&nbsp;announced that it had signed the Statement of Protocol with
the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of China. The terms of the Statement of Protocol would grant the&nbsp;PCAOB&nbsp;complete
access to audit work papers and other information so that it may inspect and investigate&nbsp;PCAOB-registered accounting firms headquartered
in China and Hong Kong. According to the&nbsp;PCAOB, its December 2021 determinations under the HFCAA remain in effect. On December 15,
2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms
headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong completely in 2022. The PCAOB Board vacated its previous 2021 determination that the PCAOB
was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. Under
the&nbsp;PCAOB&rsquo;s rules, a reassessment of a determination under the HFCAA may result in the&nbsp;PCAOB&nbsp;reaffirming, modifying
or vacating the determination. In the event it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely the Company&rsquo;s
auditor because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction, then such lack of inspection could cause trading in the
Company&rsquo;s securities to be prohibited under the HFCAA ultimately result in a determination by a securities exchange to delist the
Company&rsquo;s securities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Short selling is the practice of selling securities
that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later
date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed
securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the
sale. As it is in the short seller&rsquo;s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for
the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum
and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in
the market.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Public companies listed in the United States that
have a substantial majority of their operations in China, including Hong Kong, have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny
and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial
and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases,
allegations of fraud. As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations
and, in the interim, are subject to stockholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.</P>

allegations made by short sellers. Any such allegations may be followed by periods of instability in the market price of our Common Stock
and negative publicity. If and when we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true
or untrue, we could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we
would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant
short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable federal or state law, or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation
could be costly and time-consuming and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations are ultimately
proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations and stockholder&rsquo;s equity, and the
value of any investment in our Common Stock could be greatly reduced or rendered worthless.</P>

2025 and August 8, 2025, respectively, which indicated that the Company has not generated any revenue in 2025. Based on the Staff&rsquo;s
review of the Company and pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5101, Nasdaq believes that the Company no longer has an operating business and
is therefore a &ldquo;public shell,&rdquo; and that the continued listing of its Common Stock is no longer warranted. The Notice further
advised that, unless the Company timely requests a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the &ldquo;Panel&rdquo;), it would be subject to delisting.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Company disagrees with Nasdaq&rsquo;s view
regarding the Company&rsquo;s status as a &ldquo;public shell&rdquo; and accordingly, intends to timely request a hearing. The hearing
request will automatically stay any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension
period that may be granted by the Panel pursuant to the hearing. There can be no assurance that the Company&rsquo;s appeal of the delisting
determination will be successful, or that, if successful, the Company will be able to maintain compliance with all applicable listing
criteria.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq, whether
because Nasdaq determines Next Technology is a &ldquo;public shell&rdquo; or Next Technology fails to maintain compliance with the continued
listed requirements, or otherwise, our securities may qualify for trading over-the-counter (&ldquo;OTC&rdquo;), in the United States on
a market colloquially referred to as the &ldquo;Pink Sheets.&rdquo; Securities quoted on OTC are generally subject to lesser requirements
than securities listed for trading on a U.S. national stock exchange, such as Nasdaq, including reduced corporate governance and public
reporting standards. If Nasdaq should delist our Common Stock from trading, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each
of which could have a material adverse effect on holders of our Common Stock: the liquidity of the Common Stock; the market price of the
Common Stock; the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in the Common Stock; the number of investors
in general that will consider investing in the Common Stock; the number of market makers in the Common Stock; the availability of information
concerning the trading prices and volume of the Common Stock; and the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in the Common
Stock. In addition to the foregoing, there are certain consequences under the Securities Act, of being a public shell company, including
the unavailability of Rule 144 thereunder for the resale of restricted securities and the inability to utilize Form S-8 for the registration
of employee benefit plan securities.</P>

conducting business through our subsidiaries&rsquo; operation in China. WeTrade does not conduct our business through variable interest
entity structure. Our equity structure is a direct holding structure. However, as a holding company with no material operations of our
own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through our subsidiaries established in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.
Investors in our common stock should be aware that they will not and may never directly hold equity interests in the PRC operating entities,
but instead are purchasing equity in Wetrade Group Inc., a Wyoming holding company with no material operations of its own. Because of
our corporate structure, we as well as the investors are subject to unique risks due to uncertainty of the interpretation and the application
of the PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to limitation on foreign ownership of internet technology companies. We are
also subject to the risks of uncertainty about any future actions of the PRC government in this regard. We may also subject to sanctions
imposed by PRC regulatory agencies including Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission if we fail to comply with their rules and regulations.</P>

laws to provide funding to our subsidiaries in Singapore, Hong Kong and PRC through loans or capital contributions without restrictions
on the amount of the funds, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration, approval and filing requirements. Each of our
subsidiaries in Singapore and Hong Kong is also permitted under the laws of Singapore and Hong Kong to provide funding to WeTrade Group
Inc. through dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount of the funds. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries
to pay dividends to the Company only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards
and regulations. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not made any transfers, dividends or distributions to the U.S. investors,
and there has been no distribution of dividends or assets between the holding company and our subsidiaries. We currently intend to retain
all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying
any dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently do not have any cash management policies in place. See &ldquo;Prospectus Summary

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Because our operations are primarily located
in the PRC and Hong Kong through our subsidiaries, we are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with our operations
in China, including changes in the legal, political and economic policies of the Chinese government, the relations between China and the
United States, or Chinese or United States regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain, and therefore, these
risks may result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock, or could significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline
or be worthless. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations
in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over
China-based companies listed overseas using a variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity
reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. We do not believe that our subsidiaries are directly subject to these
regulatory actions or statements, as we have not implemented any monopolistic behavior and our business does not involve the collection
of user data or implicate cybersecurity. As of the date of this prospectus, no relevant laws or regulations in the PRC explicitly require
us to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, or any other PRC governmental authorities for our offering,
nor has our Wyoming holding company or any of our subsidiaries received any inquiry, notice, warning or sanctions regarding our offering
from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities. However, since these statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government
are newly published and official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative
or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations
will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business
operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. The Standing Committee of the National
People&rsquo;s Congress, or the SCNPC, or other PRC regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations or implementing
rules that requires our company or any of our subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before offering in the
U.S. In other words, although the Company is currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC federal or local government
to obtain such permission and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly
or indirectly; our ability to offer, or continue to offer, securities to investors would be potentially hindered and the value of our
securities might significantly decline or be worthless, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry
or by intervene or interruption by PRC governmental authorities, if we or our subsidiaries (i) do not receive or maintain such permissions
or approvals, (ii) inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, (iii) applicable laws, regulations, or
interpretations change and we are required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, or (iv) any intervention or interruption
by PRC governmental with little advance notice.</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act, or the HFCAA, if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, is unable to inspect an issuer&rsquo;s auditors for
three consecutive years, the issuer&rsquo;s securities are prohibited to trade on a U.S. stock exchange. The PCAOB issued a Determination
Report on December 16, 2021 which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms
headquartered in: (1) mainland China of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China because of a position taken by one or more authorities in
mainland China; and (2) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more
authorities in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the PCAOB&rsquo;s report identified the specific registered public accounting firms which are subject
to these determinations. On June 22, 2021, United States Senate has passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act,
or the Accelerating HFCAA, which, if enacted, would decrease the number of &ldquo;non-inspection years&rdquo; from three years to two
years, and thus, would reduce the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted if the PCAOB determines that it
cannot inspect or investigate completely our auditor. As of the date of the prospectus, TAAD LLP (&ldquo;TAAD&rdquo;), our auditor, is
<U>not</U> subject to the determinations as to inability to inspect or investigate completely as announced by the PCAOB on December 16,
2021. However, recent developments with respect to audits of China-based companies create uncertainty about the ability of TAAD to fully
cooperate with the PCAOB&rsquo;s request for audit workpapers without the approval of the Chinese authorities. On August 26, 2022, the
PCAOB announced that it had signed a Statement of Protocol (the &ldquo;Statement of Protocol&rdquo;) with the China Securities Regulatory
Commission and the Ministry of Finance of China. The terms of the Statement of Protocol would grant the PCAOB complete access to audit
work papers and other information so that it may inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered accounting firms headquartered in China and
Hong Kong. According to the PCAOB, its December 2021 determinations under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the &ldquo;HFCA
Act&rdquo;) remain in effect. The PCAOB is required to reassess these determinations by the end of 2022. Under the PCAOB&rsquo;s rules,
a reassessment of a determination under the HFCA Act may result in the PCAOB reaffirming, modifying or vacating the determination. In
the event it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely the Company&rsquo;s auditor because of
a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction, then such lack of inspection could cause trading in the Company&rsquo;s securities
to be prohibited under the HFCAA ultimately result in a determination by a securities exchange to delist the Company&rsquo;s securities.
See &ldquo;<I>Risk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - The recent joint statement by the SEC and PCAOB, proposed rule
changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to
be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not
inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to our offering</I>&rdquo; beginning on page 28 of this prospectus.</B></P>

on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We are a holding company incorporated in the state
of Wyoming. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through our
subsidiaries established in China. Investors in our common stock should be aware that they may never directly hold equity interests in
the Chinese operating entities, but rather purchasing equity solely in WeTrade Group Inc., our Wyoming holding company, which does not
directly own substantially all of our business in China conducted by our subsidiaries. Our common stock are shares of our U.S. holding
company instead of shares of our subsidiaries in China. Because of our corporate structure, we as well as the investors are subject to
unique risks due to uncertainty of the interpretation and the application of the PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to
limitation on foreign ownership of internet technology companies. We are also subject to the risks of uncertainty about any future actions
of the PRC government in this regard. We may also subject to sanctions imposed by PRC regulatory agencies including Chinese Securities
Regulatory Commission if we fail to comply with their rules and regulations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">There may be prominent risks associated with our
majority of operations being in China. For example, as a U.S.-listed Chinese public company we may face heightened scrutiny, criticism
and negative publicity, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock. It could also significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to
significantly decline or be worthless. Additionally, changes in Chinese internal regulatory mandates, such as the M&amp;A rules, Anti-Monopoly
Law, and the soon to be effective Data Security Law, may target the Company's corporate structure and impact our ability to conduct business
in the PRC, accept foreign investments, or list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a description of relevant PRC-related risks
to our Common Stock, see &quot;Risk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China&quot; and &quot;Risk Factors - Risks Related to
our Common Stock.&quot;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">WeTrade is a Wyoming incorporated holding company,
conducting business through its subsidiaries&rsquo; operation in China. WeTrade does not conduct business through variable interest entity
structure. Our PRC subsidiaries are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with being based in China and having a majority
of our operations in China. PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain, and
therefore, these risks may result in a material change in our operations, significant depreciation of the value of our common stock, or
a complete hindrance of our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to
significantly decline or be worthless. The PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business
operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures
to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. Since these statements and regulatory
actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing
or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential
impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on the daily business operation of PRC subsidiaries and our ability to accept
foreign investments and list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. These risks may cause significant depreciation of the value of our
common stock, or a complete hinderance of our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors. See &ldquo;<I>Risk Factors

on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions

Department of Hong Kong, no tax is payable in Hong Kong in respect of dividends paid by us. The laws and regulations of the PRC do not
currently have any material impact on transfer of cash from WeTrade Group Inc. to WeTrade Technology or from WeTrade Technology to WeTrade

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries
to pay dividends to WeTrade Technology only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting
standards and regulations. In addition, each of our subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits
each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Each of such entity in China
is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be
set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other
ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve
funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The PRC government also imposes controls on the
conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in
completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits,
if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict
their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations,
we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Cash dividends, if any, on our common stock will
be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders
may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10.0%.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In order for us to pay dividends to our shareholders,
we will rely on payments made from our PRC subsidiaries to WeTrade Technology. Certain payments from our PRC subsidiaries to WeTrade Technology
are subject to PRC taxes, including business taxes and VAT. As of the date of this prospectus, our PRC subsidiaries have not made any
transfers or distributions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Pursuant to the Arrangement between Mainland China
and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income, or the Double Tax Avoidance
Arrangement, the 10% withholding tax rate may be lowered to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns no less than 25% of a PRC entity.
However, the 5% withholding tax rate does not automatically apply and certain requirements must be satisfied, including, without limitation,
that (a) the Hong Kong entity must be the beneficial owner of the relevant dividends; and (b) the Hong Kong entity must directly hold
no less than 25% share ownership in the PRC entity during the 12 consecutive months preceding its receipt of the dividends. In current
practice, a Hong Kong entity must obtain a tax resident certificate from the Hong Kong tax authority to apply for the 5% lower PRC withholding
tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case basis, we cannot assure you that
we will be able to obtain the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority and enjoy the preferential withholding
tax rate of 5% under the Double Taxation Arrangement with respect to dividends to be paid by our PRC subsidiary to its immediate holding
company, WeTrade Technology. As of the date of this prospectus, Yueshang Information Technology (Beijing) Limited currently does not have
plan to declare and pay dividends to WeTrade Technology and we have not applied for the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong
Kong tax authority. WeTrade Technology intends to apply for the tax resident certificate when Yueshang Information Technology (Beijing)
Limited plans to declare and pay dividends to WeTrade Technology. When Yueshang Information Technology (Beijing) Limited plans to declare
and pay dividends to WeTrade Technology and when we intend to apply for the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority,
we plan to inform the investors through SEC filings, such as a current report on Form 8-K, prior to such actions. See &ldquo;Risk Factors
- <I>Risks Related to Doing Business in China</I> - <I>We are a holding company, and will rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for
our cash needs. Any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments to us, or any tax implications of making dividend

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On December 24, 2021, the CSRC, together with
other relevant government authorities in China issued the Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities
Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), and the Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing
by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (&ldquo;Draft Overseas Listing Regulations&rdquo;). The Draft Overseas Listing Regulations
requires that a PRC domestic enterprise seeking to issue and list its shares overseas (&ldquo;Overseas Issuance and Listing&rdquo;) shall
complete the filing procedures of and submit the relevant information to CSRC. The Overseas Issuance and Listing includes direct and indirect
issuance and listing. Where an enterprise whose principal business activities are conducted in PRC seeks to issue and list its shares
in the name of an overseas enterprise (&ldquo;Overseas Issuer&rdquo;) on the basis of the equity, assets, income or other similar rights
and interests of the relevant PRC domestic enterprise, such activities shall be deemed an indirect overseas issuance and listing (&ldquo;Indirect
Overseas Issuance and Listing&rdquo;) under the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations. Therefore, the proposed listing would be deemed an
Indirect Overseas Issuance and Listing under the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations. As such, the Company would be required to complete
the filing procedures of and submit the relevant information to CSRC after the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations become effective.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition, on December 28, 2021, the CAC, the
National Development and Reform Commission (&ldquo;NDRC&rdquo;), and several other administrations jointly issued the revised Measures
for Cybersecurity Review, or the Revised Review Measures, which became effective and replace the existing Measures for Cybersecurity Review
on February 15, 2022. According to the Revised Review Measures, if an &ldquo;online platform operator&rdquo; that is in possession of
personal data of more than one million users intends to list in a foreign country, it must apply for a cybersecurity review. Based on
a set of Q&amp;A published on the official website of the State Cipher Code Administration in connection with the issuance of the Revised
Review Measures, an official of the said administration indicated that an online platform operator should apply for a cybersecurity review
prior to the submission of its listing application with non-PRC securities regulators. Given the recency of the issuance of the Revised
Review Measures and their pending effectiveness, there is a general lack of guidance and substantial uncertainties exist with respect
to their interpretation and implementation. For example, it is unclear whether the requirement of cybersecurity review applies to follow-on
offerings by an &ldquo;online platform operator&rdquo; that is in possession of personal data of more than one million users where the
offshore holding company of such operator is already listed overseas. Furthermore, the CAC released the draft of the Regulations on Network
Data Security Management in November 2021 for public consultation, which among other things, stipulates that a data processor listed overseas
must conduct an annual data security review by itself or by engaging a data security service provider and submit the annual data security
review report for a given year to the municipal cybersecurity department before January 31 of the following year. If the draft Regulations
on Network Data Security Management are enacted in the current form, we, as an overseas listed company, will be required to carry out
an annual data security review and comply with the relevant reporting obligations. For more information, see &ldquo;<I>Risk Factors -
Risks Related to Doing Business in China - The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct

investors, however, if our subsidiaries or the holding company were required to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission

is required for this offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC, the Cyberspace Administration of China or other PRC regulatory agencies.
These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in China, limit our ability to pay dividends outside of China,
limit our operations in China, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from this offering into China or take other actions
that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading
price of our securities. The CSRC, the Cyberspace Administration of China or other PRC regulatory agencies also may take actions requiring
us, or making it advisable for us, to halt this offering before settlement and delivery of our securities. Consequently, if you engage
in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to settlement and delivery, you do so at the risk that settlement and
delivery may not occur. In addition, if the CSRC, the Cyberspace Administration of China or other regulatory PRC agencies later promulgate
new rules requiring that we obtain their approvals for this offering, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of such approval requirements,
if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such an approval
requirement could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our securities.</P>

(&ldquo;HFCAA&rdquo;)</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final
rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the Holding Foreign Company Accountable Act,
or the HFCAA. An identified issuer will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a &ldquo;non-inspection&rdquo;
year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. In June 2021, the Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies
Accountable Act, which, if signed into law, would reduce the time period for the delisting of foreign companies under the HFCAA to two
consecutive years instead of three years. If our auditor cannot be inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the
PCAOB, for two consecutive years, the trading of our securities on any U.S. national securities exchanges, as well as any over-the-counter
trading in the U.S., will be prohibited. On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the HFCAA, which provides
a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCAA, whether the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate
completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities
in that jurisdiction. On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements
in the HFCA Act. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by
a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely
because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations
that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in
Hong Kong, because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions.<B>&nbsp;</B>On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB announced that
it had signed a Statement of Protocol (the &ldquo;Statement of Protocol&rdquo;) with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the
Ministry of Finance of China. The terms of the Statement of Protocol would grant the PCAOB complete access to audit work papers and other
information so that it may inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered accounting firms headquartered in China and Hong Kong. According to
the PCAOB, its December 2021 determinations under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the &ldquo;HFCA Act&rdquo;) remain in
effect. The PCAOB is required to reassess these determinations by the end of 2022. Under the PCAOB&rsquo;s rules, a reassessment of a
determination under the HFCA Act may result in the PCAOB reaffirming, modifying or vacating the determination.</P>

public accounting firm of the Company, is headquartered in Diamond Bar, California, with no branches or offices outside of the United
States. TAAD is currently subject to the PCAOB inspections under a regular basis, with the last inspection being conducted in February
2021. Therefore, we believe our auditor is not subject to the determinations as to the inability to inspect or investigate registered
firms completely announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. However, as more stringent criteria have been imposed by the SEC and the
PCAOB, recently, which would add uncertainties to our offering, and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would
apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor&rsquo;s audit procedures and quality
control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the

strain of coronavirus, later named COVID-19, has severely impacted China and the rest of the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health
Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has led governments and other authorities around the world to impose
measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, gatherings of large numbers of people, and business
operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and social distancing measures.
As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have caused a severe decline in global travel.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Furthermore, the effects of a subvariant of the
Omicron variant of COVID-19, which may spread faster than the original Omicron variant, as well as the effects of any new variants and
subvariants which may develop, including any actions taken by governments, may have the effect of increasing the already-existing supply
chain problems or slowing our sales. Moreover, China&rsquo;s policy of effecting closures to avoid infections, including the recent lockdown
in many provinces and municipalities in China, could affect our results of operations. Therefore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
is rapidly evolving, and the continuation or a future resurgence of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors
that we face, which in turn could further materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations
and profitability, including in ways that are not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance in the longer term will depend on future developments,
including the duration of the outbreak and related travel advisories and restrictions and the impact of the COVID-19 on overall demand
for travel, all of which are highly uncertain and beyond our control. In addition to COVID-19, our business could also be adversely affected
by the outbreak of Ebola virus disease, H1N1 flu, H7N9 flu, avian flu, SARS, or other epidemics.</P>

and allocation of resources. While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven,
both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic
growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative

could adversely affect global energy and financial markets and thus could affect our client&rsquo;s business and our business, even though
we do not have any direct exposure to Russia or the adjoining geographic regions. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions,
and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. Any such disruptions caused by Russian military
action or resulting sanctions may magnify the impact of other risks described in this section. We cannot predict the progress or outcome
of the situation in Ukraine, as the conflict and governmental reactions are rapidly developing and beyond their control. Prolonged unrest,
intensified military activities, or more extensive sanctions impacting the region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy,
and such effect could in turn have a material adverse effect on the operations, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity
and business outlook of our business.</P>

things, require new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal

how this legislation will be modified or how it will be interpreted. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however,

CCPA and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified
laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar
and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China&rsquo;s political and economic conditions
and China&rsquo;s foreign exchange policies. The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar, has historically
been set by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi
to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of
certain foreign currencies. This change in policy caused the Renminbi to appreciate more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following
three years. Since reaching a high against the U.S. dollar in July 2008, however, the Renminbi has traded within a narrow band against
the U.S. dollar, remaining within 1% of its July 2008 high but never exceeding it. As a consequence, the Renminbi has fluctuated sharply
since July 2008 against other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar. In June 2010, the PRC government indicated that
it would again make the foreign exchange rate of the Renminbi more flexible, which increases the possibility of sharp fluctuations in
Renminbi&rsquo;s value in the future as well as the unpredictability associated with Renminbi&rsquo;s exchange rate. It is difficult to
predict how long the current situation may last and when and how it may change again.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">There remains significant international pressure
on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation
of the Renminbi against foreign currencies. Our revenues and costs are mostly denominated in the Renminbi, and a significant portion of
our financial assets are also denominated in the Renminbi. As we rely entirely on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries, any significant
revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition, and the value of, and any
dividends payable on, our common stock in foreign currency terms. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into
Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would reduce the Renminbi amount we receive from the
conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making dividend payments on our common
stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would reduce the U.S. dollar amount available
to us. Any fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar could also result in foreign currency translation
losses for financial reporting purposes. The current economic dispute between China and the United States has resulted in a loss in the
value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar for example thus illustrating the short term risk indicated above.</P>

acquired or otherwise invested wholly or partially by foreign investors in a manner prescribed under applicable PRC laws and regulations.

A foreign investor is prohibited to invest in any prohibited industry included therein. If a foreign investor is found to invest in any

its investment activities, dispose of its equity interests in or assets of the &ldquo;foreign-invested enterprise&rdquo; (&ldquo;FIE&rdquo;)
and have its income confiscated. A foreign investor may be permitted to invest in a FIE that is in a restricted industry set forth in
the &ldquo;negative list&rdquo;, provided that relevant conditions are satisfied and certain approvals are acquired from relevant PRC
governmental authorities. With respect to industries in which foreign investment is not prohibited or restricted, domestic and foreign
investors will be equally treated. On June 23, 2020, the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC (the &ldquo;MOFCOM&rdquo;) and the National Development
and Reform Commission (the &ldquo;NDRC&rdquo;) jointly issued the latest version of Negative List (Edition 2020). See &ldquo;Regulations
- PRC Laws and Regulations on Foreign Investment&rdquo;. Currently, our business falls within the permitted category. However, we cannot
assure you that our current operations or any newly-developed business in the future will still deemed to be &ldquo;permitted&rdquo; in
the &ldquo;negative list&rdquo;, which may be promulgated or be amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and the NDRC.</P>

from the MOFCOM or its local counterparts and other relevant PRC government agencies. Our main products currently manufactured by us,

There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including, but not limited

other matters. The central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing

Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return
to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant
effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then

that the company&rsquo;s app be removed from smartphone app stores. On July 5, 2021, the Chinese cybersecurity regulator launched the
same investigation on two other Internet platforms, China&rsquo;s Full Truck Alliance of Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd. (NYSE: YMM) and
Boss of KANZHUN LIMITED (Nasdaq: BZ). On July 24, 2021, the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General
Office of the State Council jointly released the Guidelines for Further Easing the Burden of Excessive Homework and Off-campus Tutoring
for Students at the Stage of Compulsory Education, pursuant to which foreign investment in such firms via mergers and acquisitions, franchise
development, and variable interest entities are banned from this sector.</P>

Review on February 15, 2022. According to the Revised Review Measures, if an &ldquo;online platform operator&rdquo; that is in possession
of personal data of more than one million users intends to list in a foreign country, it must apply for a cybersecurity review. Based
on a set of Q&amp;A published on the official website of the State Cipher Code Administration in connection with the issuance of the Revised
Review Measures, an official of the said administration indicated that an online platform operator should apply for a cybersecurity review
prior to the submission of its listing application with non-PRC securities regulators. Given the recency of the issuance of the Revised
Review Measures and their pending effectiveness, there is a general lack of guidance and substantial uncertainties exist with respect
to their interpretation and implementation. For example, it is unclear whether the requirement of cybersecurity review applies to follow-on
offerings by an &ldquo;online platform operator&rdquo; that is in possession of personal data of more than one million users where the
offshore holding company of such operator is already listed overseas. Furthermore, the CAC released the draft of the Regulations on Network
Data Security Management in November 2021 for public consultation, which among other things, stipulates that a data processor listed overseas
must conduct an annual data security review by itself or by engaging a data security service provider and submit the annual data security
review report for a given year to the municipal cybersecurity department before January 31 of the following year. If the draft Regulations
on Network Data Security Management are enacted in the current form, we, as an overseas listed company, will be required to carry out
an annual data security review and comply with the relevant reporting obligations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility
of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive most of our revenues
in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, our company may rely on dividend payments from our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries
to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account
items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign
currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements.
Therefore, our PRC subsidiaries are able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior approval from SAFE by complying with
certain procedural requirements. But approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi
is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated
in foreign currencies. This could affect the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing,
including by means of loans or capital contributions from us. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future
to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign
currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including
holders of our shares.</P>

investment, including wholly foreign-owned enterprises and joint ventures, in particular. These laws, regulations and legal requirements
are often changing, and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainties that could limit the reliability of the
legal protections available to us. We cannot predict the effects of future developments in the PRC legal system. We may be required in
the future to procure additional permits, authorizations and approvals for our existing and future operations, which may not be obtainable

National People&rsquo;s Congress passed China&rsquo;s first Cybersecurity Law (&ldquo;CSL&rdquo;), which became effective in June 2017.
The CSL is the first PRC law that systematically lays out the regulatory requirements on cybersecurity and data protection, subjecting
many previously under-regulated or unregulated activities in cyberspace to government scrutiny. The legal consequences of violation of
the CSL include penalties of warning, confiscation of illegal income, suspension of related business, winding up for rectification, shutting
down the websites, and revocation of business license or relevant permits. In April 2020, the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain
other PRC regulatory authorities promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective in June 2020. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity
Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and
services which do or may affect national security. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of
the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments (&ldquo;Draft Measures&rdquo;), which required that, in addition to &ldquo;operator
of critical information infrastructure,&rdquo; any &ldquo;data processor&rdquo; carrying out data processing activities that affect or
may affect national security should also be subject to cybersecurity review, and further elaborated the factors to be considered when
assessing the national security risks of the relevant activities, including, among others, (i) the risk of core data, important data or
a large amount of personal information being stolen, leaked, destroyed, and illegally used or exited the country; and (ii) the risk of
critical information infrastructure, core data, important data or a large amount of personal information being affected, controlled, or
maliciously used by foreign governments after listing abroad. The Cyberspace Administration of China has said that under the proposed
rules companies holding data on more than 1,000,000 users must now apply for cybersecurity approval when seeking listings in other nations
because of the risk that such data and personal information could be &ldquo;affected, controlled, and maliciously exploited by foreign
governments,&rdquo; The cybersecurity review will also investigate the potential national security risks from overseas IPOs. We do not
know what regulations will be adopted or how such regulations will affect us and our listing on Nasdaq. In the event that the Cyberspace
Administration of China determines that we are subject to these regulations, we may be required to delist from Nasdaq and we may be subject
to fines and penalties. On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the NPC promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which took effect on
September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law also sets forth the data security protection obligations for entities and individuals handling
personal data, including that no entity or individual may acquire such data by stealing or other illegal means, and the collection and
use of such data should not exceed the necessary limits The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, CSL and any other
cybersecurity and related laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business.
Further, if the enacted version of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review mandates clearance of cybersecurity review and other specific
actions to be completed by companies like us, we face uncertainties as to whether such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all.</P>

can be subject to an EIT rate of 25.0% on its global income. In April 2009, the State Administration of Taxation (the &ldquo;SAT&rdquo;)
promulgated a circular, known as Circular 82, and partially amended by Circular 9 promulgated in January 2014, to clarify the certain
criteria for the determination of the &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; for foreign enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or
PRC enterprise groups. Under Circular 82, a foreign enterprise is considered a PRC resident enterprise if all of the following apply:
(1) the senior management and core management departments in charge of daily operations are located mainly within China; (2) decisions
relating to the enterprise&rsquo;s financial and human resource matters are made or subject to approval by organizations or personnel
in China; (3) the enterprise&rsquo;s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders&rsquo; meeting
minutes are located or maintained in China; and (4) 50.0% or more of voting board members or senior executives of the enterprise habitually
reside in China. Further to Circular 82, the SAT issued a bulletin, known as Bulletin 45, effective in September 2011 and amended on 1
June 2015 and 1 October 2016 to provide more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82 and clarify the reporting and filing obligations
of such &ldquo;Chinese controlled offshore incorporated resident enterprises.&rdquo; Bulletin 45 provides for, among other matters, procedures
for the determination of resident status and administration of post-determination matters. Although Circular 82 and Bulletin 45 explicitly
provide that the above standards apply to enterprises that are registered outside China and controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise
groups, Circular 82 may reflect SAT&rsquo;s criteria for determining the tax residence of foreign enterprises in general.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are
a &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow.
First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income
tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise
income tax at a rate of 25%. Currently, we do not have any non-China source income, as we conduct our sales in China. Second, under the
EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would be deemed as &ldquo;qualified investment income
between resident enterprises&rdquo; and therefore qualify as &ldquo;tax-exempt income&rdquo; pursuant to the clause 26 of the EIT Law.
Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; classification could result
in a situation in which the dividends we pay with respect to our common stock, or the gain our non-PRC shareholders may realize from the
transfer of shares of our common stock, may be treated as PRC-sourced income and may therefore be subject to a 10% PRC withholding tax.
The EIT Law and its implementing regulations are, however, relatively new and ambiguities exist with respect to the interpretation and
identification of PRC-sourced income, and the application and assessment of withholding taxes. If we are required under the EIT Law and
its implementing regulations to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC shareholders, or if non-PRC shareholders are
required to pay PRC income tax on gains on the transfer of their shares of common stock, our business could be negatively impacted and
the value of your investment may be materially reduced. Further, if we were treated as a &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; by PRC tax
authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both China and such countries in which we have taxable income, and our PRC tax may not
be creditable against such other taxes.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As a holding company, we conduct substantially
all of our business through our consolidated subsidiaries incorporated in China. We may rely on dividends paid by these PRC subsidiaries
for our cash needs, including the funds necessary to pay any dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, to service any
debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. The payment of dividends by entities established in China is subject to limitations.
Regulations in China currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting
standards and regulations in China. In accordance with the Article 166, 168 of the Company Law of the PRC (Amended in 2013), each of our
PRC subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general
reserves or statutory capital reserve fund until the aggregate amount of such reserves reaches 50% of its respective registered capital.
A company may discontinue the contribution when the aggregate sum of the statutory surplus reserve is more than 50% of its registered
capital. The statutory common reserve fund of a company shall be used to cover the losses of the company, expand the business and production
of the company or be converted into additional capital. As a result, our PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer
a portion of their net assets to us in the form of dividends. In addition, if any of our PRC subsidiaries incurs debt on its own behalf
in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Any limitations
on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments
or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.</P>

Circular 37 and Circular 13 by our PRC resident beneficial holders. In addition, as we have little control over either our present or
prospective, direct or indirect Shareholders or the outcome of such registration procedures, we cannot assure you that these Shareholders
who are PRC residents will amend or update their registration as required under Circular 37 and Circular 13 in a timely manner or at all.
Failure of our present or future shareholders who are PRC residents to comply with Circular 37 and Circular 13 could subject these shareholders
to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to
make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.</P>

an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the business or assets in China and in certain transaction structures,
require that consideration must be paid within defined periods, generally not in excess of a year. In addition, the M&amp;A Rules also
limit our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of the initial consideration, contingent consideration,
holdback provisions, indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction

transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The SAT released a circular on December 15, 2009
that addresses the transfer of shares by nonresident companies, generally referred to as Circular 698. Circular 698, which became effective
retroactively to January 1, 2008, may have a significant impact on many companies that use offshore holding companies to invest in China.
Circular 698 has the effect of taxing foreign companies on gains derived from the indirect sale of a PRC company. Where a foreign investor
indirectly transfers equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by selling the shares in an offshore holding company, and the latter
is located in a country or jurisdiction that has an effective tax rate less than 12.5% or does not tax foreign income of its residents,
the foreign investor must report this indirect transfer to the tax authority in charge of that PRC resident enterprise. Using a &ldquo;substance
over form&rdquo; principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable
commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may
be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10.0%.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">SAT subsequently released public notices to clarify
issues relating to Circular 698, including the Announcement on Several Issues concerning the EIT on the Indirect Transfers of Properties
by Nonresident Enterprises (<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&#12298;&#20851;&#20110;&#38750;&#23621;&#27665;&#20225;&#19994;&#38388;&#25509;&#36716;&#35753;&#36130;&#20135;&#20225;&#19994;&#25152;&#24471;&#31246;&#33509;&#24178;&#38382;&#39064;&#30340;&#20844;&#21578;&#12299;</FONT>)
(the &ldquo;SAT Notice 7&rdquo;), which became effective on February 3, 2015. SAT Notice 7 abolished the compulsive reporting obligations
originally set out in Circular 698. Under SAT Notice 7, if a non-resident enterprise transfers its shares in an overseas holding company,
which directly or indirectly owns PRC taxable properties, including shares in a PRC company, via an arrangement without reasonable commercial
purpose, such transfer shall be deemed as indirect transfer of the underlying PRC taxable properties. Accordingly, the transferee shall
be deemed as a withholding agent with the obligation to withhold and remit the EIT to the competent PRC tax authorities. Factors that
may be taken into consideration when determining whether there is a &ldquo;reasonable commercial purpose&rdquo; include, among other factors,
the economic essence of the transferred shares, the economic essence of the assets held by the overseas holding company, the taxability
of the transaction in offshore jurisdictions, and economic essence and duration of the offshore structure. SAT Notice 7 also sets out
safe harbors for the &ldquo;reasonable commercial purpose&rdquo; test.</P>

on Several Issues concerning the Withholding and Collection of Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises from the Source (<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&#12298;&#20851;&#20110;&#38750;&#23621;&#27665;&#20225;&#19994;&#25152;&#24471;&#31246;&#28304;&#27849;&#25187;&#32564;&#26377;&#20851;&#38382;&#39064;&#30340;&#20844;&#21578;&#12299;</FONT>)
(the &ldquo;SAT Notice 37&rdquo;). SAT Notice 37 clarifies: (1) matters concerning the withholding and collection of corporate income
tax, and property transfer of non-resident enterprises based on the EIT Law; (2) the currencies required to be used by the withholding
agents (when the payments is made in a currency rather than RMB), as well as the time, venue and business for the performance of the withholding
and collection obligations; and (3) the abolishment of Circular 698.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">There is little guidance and practical experience
regarding the application of SAT Notice 7 and SAT Notice 37 and the related SAT notices. Moreover, the relevant authority has not yet
promulgated any formal provisions or formally declared or stated how to calculate the effective tax rates in foreign tax jurisdictions.
As a result, due to our complex offshore restructuring, we may become at risk of being taxed under SAT Notice 7 and SAT Notice 37 and
we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Notice 7 and SAT Notice 37 or to establish that we should not be taxed
under SAT Notice 7 and SAT Notice 37, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Under the PRC EIT Law and its implementation rules,
the profits of a foreign invested enterprise generated through operations, which are distributed to its immediate holding company outside
the PRC, will be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10%. Pursuant to a special arrangement between Hong Kong and the PRC, such rate
may be reduced to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25% of the equity interest in the PRC company. Moreover, under
the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues regarding the Administration of the Dividend Provision in Tax Treaties promulgated
on February 20, 2009, the tax payer needs to satisfy certain conditions to enjoy the benefits under a tax treaty. These conditions include:
(1) the taxpayer must be the beneficial owner of the relevant dividends, and (2) the corporate shareholder to receive dividends from the
PRC subsidiary must have continuously met the direct ownership thresholds during the 12 consecutive months preceding the receipt of the
dividends. Further, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Notice on How to Understand and Recognize the &ldquo;Beneficial
Owner&rdquo; in Tax Treaties on October 27, 2009, which limits the &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo; to individuals, projects or other organizations
normally engaged in substantive operations, and sets forth certain detailed factors in determining the &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo;
status. In current practice, a Hong Kong enterprise must obtain a tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority to
apply for the 5% lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case
basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority. As
of the date of this prospectus, we have not commenced the application process for a Hong Kong tax resident certificate from the relevant
Hong Kong tax authority, and there is no assurance that we will be granted such a Hong Kong tax resident certificate.</P>

with the relevant tax authorities when it plans to declare and pay dividends. We may plan to file with the tax authorities in the future.

the debentures, notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness that we may issue from time to time. The debt securities may be secured
or unsecured, senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities, and/or convertible, and which may be issued in one or more series.
The debt securities will be issued under one or more separate indentures between us and a trustee to be specified in an accompanying prospectus
supplement. Senior debt securities will be issued under a new senior indenture. Subordinated debt securities will be issued under a subordinated
indenture. Together, the senior indentures and the subordinated indentures are sometimes referred to in this prospectus as the indentures.
This prospectus, together with the applicable prospectus supplement, will describe the terms of a particular series of debt securities.</P>

maturities. Unless indicated in a prospectus supplement, we may issue additional debt securities of a particular series without the consent
of the holders of the debt securities of such series outstanding at the time of the issuance. Any such additional debt securities, together

persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain, or otherwise affect the market price of the
securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involves the sale by persons participating in the
offering of more securities than have been sold to them by us. In those circumstances, such persons would cover such over-allotments or
short positions by purchasing in the open market or by exercising the over-allotment option granted to those persons. In addition, those
persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding for or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing
penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to underwriters or dealers participating in any such offering may be reclaimed if securities
sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain
the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. Such transactions, if commenced,
may be discontinued at any time. We make no representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions
described above, if implemented, may have on the price of our securities.</P>
