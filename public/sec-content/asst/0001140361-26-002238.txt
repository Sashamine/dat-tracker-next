The liquidation preference is subject to adjustment in the manner described in this prospectus supplement. However, the liquidation preference will not be adjusted to an amount that is less than $100 per share. </div><div class="BRDSX_h2" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 18.5pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">DIVIDENDS </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">The SATA Stock accumulates cumulative dividends, which we refer to as &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">regular dividends</font>,&#8221; at a variable rate that is described more fully below and elsewhere in this prospectus supplement. Regular dividends, if any, on the shares of SATA Stock hereto will accumulate in the stated amount thereof, which is $100 per share of SATA Stock, and will be payable when, as and if declared by our &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">board of directors</font>&#8221; (as defined in this prospectus supplement) or any duly authorized committee thereof, out of funds legally available for their payment, monthly in arrears on the 15<sup style="vertical-align: text-top; line-height: 1; font-size: smaller;">th</sup> calendar day of each calendar month, beginning on February&#160;15, 2026. Concurrent &#8206;with the closing of our initial public offering of the SATA Stock on November&#160;10, 2025 (the &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">IPO Closing</font>&#8221;), we established an initial dividend &#8206;reserve in an amount equal to the first 12 months of dividend payments (which assumed dividend payments at a rate of 12.00% &#8206;per annum) calculated as of the date of the IPO Closing (the &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Initial Dividend Reserve</font>&#8221;) and deposited $12.00 per share of SATA Stock &#8206;into a separate account (the &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Dividend Payment Account</font>&#8221;) funded by us with existing cash on hand.&#8206; Concurrent &#8206;with the closing of this offering, we intend to increase the dividend &#8206;reserve in the Dividend Payment Account in an amount equal to the first 12 months of dividend payments (assuming dividend payments are made at a rate of 12.25% &#8206;per annum) calculated as of the date of the closing of this offering and will deposit $12.25 per share of SATA Stock sold in this offering into the Dividend Payment Account (together with the Initial Dividend Reserve, the &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Dividend Reserve</font>&#8221;).&#8206; </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">The regular dividend rate has been set at 12.25% per annum with respect to the regular dividend period beginning on &#8206;December&#160;16, 2025. However, we have the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to adjust the regular dividend rate applicable to subsequent regular dividend periods in the manner described in this prospectus supplement. Our right to adjust the regular dividend rate is subject to certain restrictions. For example, we are not permitted to reduce the monthly regular dividend rate per annum that applies to any regular dividend period (i) by more than the following amount from the monthly regular dividend rate per annum applicable to the prior regular dividend period: the sum of (1) 25 basis points; and (2) the excess, if any, of (x) the &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">monthly SOFR per annum</font>&#8221; (as defined in this prospectus supplement) on the first business day of such prior regular dividend period, over (y) the minimum of the monthly SOFR per annum rates that occur on the business days during the period from, and including, the first business day of such prior regular dividend period to, and including, the last business day of such prior regular dividend period; or (ii) to a rate per annum that is less than the monthly SOFR per annum in effect on the business day before we provide notice of the next monthly regular dividend rate per annum. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Our current intention, which is subject to change in our sole and absolute discretion, is to adjust the regular dividend rate in such a manner as we believe will maintain SATA Stock&#8217;s trading price within its stated long-term range of $95 and $105 per share. For example, if the trading price of SATA Stock exceeds $105, our current intention would be to reduce the regular dividend rate with the goal of causing the trading price of SATA Stock to decrease. Similarly, if the trading price of SATA Stock is less than $95, our current intention would be to increase the regular dividend rate with the goal of causing the trading price of SATA Stock to appreciate. We will take any such actions at our sole discretion based on our subjective assessment of market conditions and the measures we believe are necessary to achieve our intended objectives. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to this Offering and Our SATA Stock&#8212;We may be unsuccessful in achieving, or may abandon, our current intention of adjusting the regular dividend rate in such a manner as we believe (in our sole and absolute judgment) would be designed to cause the SATA Stock to trade at prices, or otherwise have a value, within its targeted long-term trading range of $95 and $105 per share&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to this Offering and Our SATA Stock&#8212;Our right to unilaterally reduce the regular dividend rate could cause the SATA Stock to accumulate dividends at rates that are below those of otherwise comparable instruments, could cause the trading price or value of the SATA Stock to decrease, and could otherwise significantly harm investors.&#8221; Further, for any additional shares of SATA Stock that we issue (in this offering or in any future offering), our current intention (which is subject to change in our sole and absolute discretion) is to issue any such shares of SATA Stock at a price per share not less than $95 or more than $110. Because the record date for the dividend payment date occurring on February&#160;1, 2026 will occur after closing of this offering, investors in this offering will be entitled to receive the dividend payable on February&#160;15, 2026.</div></div></div></div>

Under Rule&#160;15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Exchange Act</font>&#8221;), trades in the secondary market generally must settle in one business day, unless the parties to the trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade SATA Stock before the business day before the settlement date must, because the SATA Stock initially will settle T+3, specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Those purchasers should consult their advisors. </div><div><div class="BRDSX_rule-partial" style="height: 0pt; width: 96pt; border-bottom: 1pt solid #000000; margin-bottom: 2pt; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 15.25pt;"> </div></div><div class="BRDSX_fpara" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 8.5pt; text-align: center;">Joint Book-Running Managers</div><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="BRDSX_txttab" style="margin-top: 4pt; width: 528pt; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tr class="BRDSX_boxspacer"><td style="height: 6pt; width: 96pt;"><div style="font-size: 1pt;">&#8194;</div></td><td style="height: 6pt; width: 6pt;"><div style="font-size: 1pt;">&#8194;</div></td><td style="height: 6pt; width: 6pt;"><div style="font-size: 1pt;">&#8194;</div></td><td style="height: 6pt; width: 420pt;"><div style="font-size: 1pt;">&#8194;</div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 96pt; text-align: left; vertical-align: top;"><div class="BRDSX_fpara" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">Barclays</div></td><td style="width: 6pt;"><div style="font-size: 1pt;">&#8194;</div></td><td style="width: 6pt;"><div style="font-size: 1pt;">&#8194;</div></td><td style="width: 420pt; text-align: left; vertical-align: bottom;"><div class="BRDSX_fpara" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: right;">Cantor</div></td></tr><tr class="BRDSX_boxspacer"><td style="height: 2.75pt; width: 96pt;"><div style="font-size: 1pt;">&#8194;</div></td><td style="height: 2.75pt; width: 6pt;"><div style="font-size: 1pt;">&#8194;</div></td><td style="height: 2.75pt; width: 6pt;"><div style="font-size: 1pt;">&#8194;</div></td><td style="height: 2.75pt; width: 420pt;"><div style="font-size: 1pt;">&#8194;</div></td></tr></table><div class="BRDSX_fpara" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 6.5pt; text-align: center;">Co-Manager</div><div class="BRDSX_fpara" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 8.5pt; text-align: center;">Clear Street</div><div class="BRDSX_fpara" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 362.5pt; text-align: center;">The date of this prospectus supplement is January&#160;22, 2026.</div></div></div></div>

Following the completion of Strive Enterprises, Inc.&#8217;s reverse acquisition of Asset Entities Inc. in September&#160;2025, Strive began operating as a publicly traded company and began deploying capital to execute on its bitcoin treasury strategy, becoming the first publicly traded bitcoin treasury asset management firm. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">As of December&#160;31, 2025, the Company manages over $2.3 billion in assets under management (&#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">AUM</font>&#8221;) across 13 exchange-traded funds, collective investment trusts, and a direct indexing platform.

For example, we are not permitted to reduce the monthly regular dividend rate per annum that applies to any regular dividend period (i) by more than the following amount from the monthly regular dividend rate per annum applicable to the prior regular dividend period: the sum of (1) 25 basis points; and (2) the excess, if any, of (x) the monthly SOFR per annum on the first business day of such prior regular dividend period, over (y) the minimum of the monthly SOFR per annum rates that occur on the business days during the period from, and including, the first business day of such prior regular dividend period to, and including, the last business day of such prior regular dividend period; or (ii) to a rate per annum that is less than the monthly SOFR per&#160;annum in effect on the business day before we provide notice of the next regular dividend rate. In addition, subject to the more detailed provisions described in this prospectus supplement, we are not entitled to reduce the monthly regular dividend rate per annum unless, at the time we provide the related notice of the adjustment, all accumulated regular dividends, if any, on the SATA Stock then outstanding for all prior completed regular dividend periods, if any, have been paid in full (or have been declared in full and consideration in kind and amount that is sufficient, in accordance with the certificate of designation, to pay such accumulated regular dividends, is set aside for the benefit of the preferred stockholders entitled thereto).

We may, at any time in our sole and absolute discretion, and without the consent of any preferred stockholder, choose to reduce the monthly regular dividend rate per annum to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the SATA Stock, without regard to the impact that reduction may have on the trading price or value of the SATA Stock. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">If we reduce the monthly regular dividend rate per annum, then the trading price or value of the SATA Stock could decrease significantly. If you hold SATA Stock at the time of such a decrease, the value of your investment could materially depreciate, and you may not be able to resell your SATA Stock at favorable prices, if at all. Moreover, the mere existence of our right to unilaterally reduce the monthly regular dividend rate per annum could, in itself and without any actual reduction in the monthly regular dividend rate per annum, cause the SATA Stock to trade at prices below those that may otherwise be expected. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the limitations on our ability to reduce the monthly regular dividend rate per annum, the trading price of SATA Stock could decline significantly if, for example, we reduce the dividend rate in successive regular dividend periods, or there is a market expectation that we do so. Further, consecutive monthly reductions of the regular dividends rate on the SATA Stock may cause the regular dividend rate on SATA Stock to be viewed as reasonably expected to decline, which could result in adverse consequences to holders of SATA Stock. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;The tax rules applicable to &#8220;fast-pay stock&#8221; could result in adverse consequences to holders of SATA Stock&#8221; below. If we reduce the monthly regular dividend rate per annum to the minimum dividend rate of the monthly SOFR per annum, and the monthly SOFR per annum thereafter increases, we have no obligation to increase the monthly regular dividend rate per annum to the new monthly SOFR per annum. Moreover, SOFR has a limited history, and its future performance cannot be predicted. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Despite our current intention, which is to adjust the monthly regular dividend rate per annum in such a manner as we believe will maintain SATA Stock&#8217;s trading price within its stated long-term range of $95 and $105 per share, since we are permitted to exercise our right to adjust the monthly regular dividend rate per annum for any reason, the trading price of the SATA Stock could be significantly volatile. For example, we could choose to adjust the monthly regular dividend rate per annum for reasons not directly related to the market value of our bitcoin holdings, the credit spreads on our other debt and preferred stock instruments, or the interest rate environment. Accordingly, the trading profile of our SATA Stock could be significantly different than that of our other securities. Increased volatility could harm investors by, for example, causing wide fluctuations in the implied yield of the SATA Stock and otherwise increasing the uncertainty regarding the price at which investors may resell their SATA Stock, if at all. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Certain provisions of the SATA Stock are intended to protect investors in the event we fail to declare and pay regular dividends on the SATA Stock. These provisions include restrictions on our ability to make payments on, or engage in certain other transactions relating to, other classes of our capital stock that rank junior to, or on parity with, the SATA Stock. See &#8220;Description of Perpetual Preferred Stock&#8212;Regular Dividends&#8212;Priority of Dividends; Limitation on Junior Payments; No Participation Rights.&#8221; Our ability to reduce the monthly regular dividend rate&#160;per&#160;annum could cause these provisions to be inadequate to protect investors. For example, we could reduce the monthly regular dividend rate per annum to a sufficiently low rate that permits us to pay all accumulated regular dividends and avoid invoking the protective measures of these provisions. </div></div></div><div class="BRDSX_block-frill" style="width: 468pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-left: 0pt;"><div class="BRDSX_unknown" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 9.47pt; text-align: center;">S-13<br></div></div></div>

Holding SATA Stock does not confer the right to vote together with holders of our Class&#160;A Common Stock on matters on which our holders of Class&#160;A Common Stock are entitled to vote. For example, holders of SATA Stock, as such, do not have the right to vote in the general election of our directors, although those holders will have a limited right, voting together with holders of any voting parity stock, if any, with similar voting rights regarding the election of directors upon a failure to pay dividends, which similar voting rights are then exercisable, to elect one director upon the occurrence of a &#8220;regular dividend non-payment event&#8221; (as defined below under the caption &#8220;Description of Perpetual Preferred Stock&#8212;Definitions&#8221;). See &#8220;Description of Perpetual Preferred Stock&#8212;Voting Rights&#8212;Right to Designate up to Two Preferred Stock Directors Upon Regular Dividend Non-Payment Events.&#8221; However, because certain existing holders of Strive, including Vivek Ramaswamy, by virtue of our dual-class structure, control a majority of the voting power of our Common Stock, the impact of any such election may be limited.

However, the terms of the SATA Stock do not impose any contractual restrictions or limit our discretion on how we may use the funds in the Dividend Payment Account, nor grant any liens or contractual rights in favor of the holders of SATA Stock over such funds. For example, we are permitted to invest the proceeds of the Dividend Payment Account in various capital preservation instruments, including short-term investment grade, interest-bearing securities, and money-market funds. We expect that any investment income earned from the Dividend Payment Account will be remitted to us to use for working capital or general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of additional bitcoin. In addition, we are not contractually required to increase our contributions to the Dividend Payment Account if the dividend rate increases above 12.25% or if we issue additional SATA Stock following this offering. In the event we experience any insolvency issues and/or file for bankruptcy, the proceeds held in the Dividend Payment Account could be subject to the claims of creditors. </div></div></div><div class="BRDSX_block-frill" style="width: 468pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-left: 0pt;"><div class="BRDSX_unknown" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 9.47pt; text-align: center;">S-15<br></div></div></div>

Comments we make regarding our intentions regarding the adjustment of the monthly regular dividend rate per annum could also impact the trading price and value of the SATA Stock. Modeling the impact of market expectations on the trading price of the SATA Stock may be impossible.

The liquidation preference of the SATA Stock is subject to adjustment in the manner described in this prospectus supplement, which adjustment may result in an increase in the liquidation preference. In addition, if our board of directors does not declare a dividend on the SATA Stock in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, the deferred dividend may be treated as an increase in the liquidation preference of the SATA Stock. In either case, any increase in the liquidation preference could give rise to a deemed dividend to holders of SATA Stock. Although the matter is not entirely clear, we believe any such adjustment of liquidation preference in the manner described in this prospectus supplement, deferred dividend, discount or call premium should not be treated as giving rise to a deemed distribution on the SATA Stock. However, there is no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">IRS</font>&#8221;) or an applicable withholding agent will not take a contrary position. It is also possible you may be treated as receiving a deemed distribution under Section&#160;305 of the Code if we elect to increase the price at which we exercise our optional redemption right, with the likelihood of such treatment depending on the circumstances existing at the time the redemption price is adjusted. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Any deemed distribution will generally be taxable to the same extent as a cash distribution. In addition, for any holder of SATA Stock that is a &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">non-U.S. holder</font>&#8221; (as defined in &#8220;Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations&#8221;), any deemed distribution could be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty. Because deemed distributions received by a holder of SATA Stock would not give rise to any cash from which any applicable withholding tax could be satisfied, if we (or an applicable withholding agent) pay withholding (including backup withholding) on behalf of a holder of SATA Stock, we (or an applicable withholding agent) may set off any such payment against, or withhold such taxes from, payments of cash to such holder of SATA Stock or sales proceeds received by, or other funds or assets of, such holder of SATA Stock, or require alternative arrangements with respect to such withholding taxes. </div></div></div><div class="BRDSX_block-frill" style="width: 468pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-left: 0pt;"><div class="BRDSX_unknown" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 9.47pt; text-align: center;">S-17<br></div></div></div>

In addition, under the Fast-Pay Stock Regulations, unless clearly demonstrated otherwise, stock is presumed to be fast-pay stock if it is structured to have a dividend that is reasonably expected to decline (as opposed to a dividend rate that is reasonably expected to fluctuate or remain constant) (for such purpose, the dividend rate may be viewed as reasonably expected to decline if we are reasonably expected to stop paying regular dividends on the SATA Stock or if we are reasonably expected to reduce the monthly regular dividend rate over a meaningful time period) or is issued for an amount that exceeds (by more than a de minimis amount, as determined under applicable Treasury Regulations) the amount at which the stockholder can be compelled to dispose of the stock.

To determine whether it is fast-pay stock, stock is examined when issued, and, for stock that is not fast-pay stock when issued, when there is a significant modification in the terms of the stock or the related agreements or a significant change in the relevant facts and circumstances. The relevant tax regulations do not indicate the types of significant changes in facts and circumstances that are intended to give rise to such a determination, and therefore it is possible that such a change could arise when, for example, there is a change to the terms of optional redemption or a compounded dividend rate comes into effect. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">We do not believe that the SATA Stock offered hereunder (or any SATA Stock we have previously issued) is fast-pay stock. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">We have issued shares of SATA Stock pursuant to (i) our prospectus supplement dated as of November&#160;10, 2025 in connection with our initial public offering and (ii) our prospectus supplement dated as of December&#160;9, 2025 in connection with our at-the-market offering, and may otherwise issue additional shares of SATA Stock, including pursuant to the prospectus supplement described in (ii) or resell any shares of SATA stock that we or any of our subsidiaries have purchased or otherwise acquired (such additional or resold shares, the &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Shares</font>&#8221;). We do not intend to issue any Additional Shares that would be treated as fast-pay stock. Moreover, we intend to obtain advice of counsel in connection with future offerings of Additional Shares for the purpose of analyzing the consequences of issuing such Additional Shares in light of any legal developments regarding the definition of fast-pay stock. As the liquidation preference of the SATA Stock will be subject to adjustment in the manner described in this prospectus supplement and our current intention is to issue any Additional Shares at a price per share not more than $110 plus accrued and unpaid dividends that may apply to such instrument at the time of its issuance, it is generally not expected that the Additional Shares would be issued at such a level of premium above their liquidation preference or optional redemption price at the time of sale of the Additional Shares so as to implicate the fast-pay stock rules. In addition, we do not intend to adjust the regular dividend rate in a manner that would cause the SATA Stock to be treated as fast-pay stock. Any adjustment to the regular dividend rate is expected to be consistent with our current intention to maintain a long-term trading level for the SATA Stock between $95 and $105 per share, and therefore the SATA Stock&#8217;s dividend rate is generally expected to fluctuate over time. Nonetheless, there may be increased risk that the IRS could assert that such Additional Shares constitute fast-pay stock. </div></div></div><div class="BRDSX_block-frill" style="width: 468pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-left: 0pt;"><div class="BRDSX_unknown" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 9.47pt; text-align: center;">S-18<br></div></div></div>

In addition, bitcoin does not pay interest or other returns and so the ability to generate a return on investment from the net proceeds from this offering will depend on whether there is appreciation in the value of bitcoin following our purchases of bitcoin with the net proceeds from this offering. Future fluctuations in bitcoin trading prices may result in our converting bitcoin purchased with the net proceeds from this offering into cash with a value substantially below the net proceeds from this offering. </div><div class="BRDSX_frisk" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20.5pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: justify;">The accounting method for the SATA Stock may result in lower reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">The accounting method for reflecting the provisions of the SATA Stock in our financial statements may adversely affect our reported earnings. We expect that applicable accounting standards will require us to separately account for certain redemption features associated with the SATA Stock as embedded derivatives. Under this treatment, any embedded derivatives will be measured at their fair value and accounted for separately as liabilities that are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period. For each financial statement period after the issuance of the SATA Stock, a gain or loss will be reported in our statement of operations to the extent the valuation of any of the embedded derivatives changes from the previous period. This accounting treatment may subject our reported net income (loss) to significant non-cash volatility. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Furthermore, we have not reached a final determination regarding the accounting treatment for the SATA Stock, and the description above is preliminary.

Beneficial interests in global &#8206;certificates are shown on, and transfers of global certificates are effected only through, the records maintained by &#8206;DTC. Except in limited circumstances, we will not issue physical certificates representing the SATA Stock. See &#8220;Description of Perpetual Preferred Stock&#8212;Book Entry, Settlement and Clearance.&#8221; Accordingly, if you own a beneficial interest in a global certificate, then you will not be considered an owner or holder of the SATA Stock. Instead, DTC or its nominee will be the sole holder of the SATA Stock. Payments of cash dividends and other cash amounts on global certificates will be made to the paying agent, who will remit the payments to DTC. We expect that DTC will then credit those payments to the DTC participant accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global certificates and that those participants will credit the payments to indirect DTC participants. Unlike persons who have physical certificates registered in their names, owners of beneficial interests in global certificates will not have the direct right to act on our solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the SATA Stock. Instead, those beneficial owners will be permitted to act only to the extent that they have received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or, if applicable, a DTC participant. The applicable procedures for the granting of these proxies may not be sufficient to enable owners of beneficial interests in global certificates to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis. </div></div></div><div class="BRDSX_block-frill" style="width: 468pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-left: 0pt;"><div class="BRDSX_unknown" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 9.47pt; text-align: center;">S-21<br></div></div></div>

Our failure to repurchase the Semler Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Convertible Notes Indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Semler Convertible Notes as required by the Convertible Notes Indenture would constitute a default under the Convertible Notes Indenture.

Failure to consummate the Semler Debt Transactions on the terms described herein or at all, may result in a capital structure different from those presented herein, which may be less favorable to Strive. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset that has traded below approximately $74,000 per bitcoin and above approximately $124,000 per bitcoin in our principal market in the 12 months preceding the date of this prospectus supplement. Bitcoin does not pay interest or other returns and so our ability to generate cash from our bitcoin holdings depends on sales. Future fluctuations in bitcoin trading prices may result in our converting bitcoin purchased with the net proceeds from this offering into cash with a value substantially below the net proceeds from this offering, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will realize any cash proceeds from our contemplated acquisition of bitcoin. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">We have not determined the specific amount of the net proceeds to be used for such purposes. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of our SATA&#160;Stock offered by this prospectus supplement and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the net proceeds are being used in a manner of which you approve. </div></div></div><div class="BRDSX_block-frill" style="width: 468pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-left: 0pt;"><div class="BRDSX_unknown" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 9.47pt; text-align: center;">S-24<br></div></div></div>

Prospective investors are advised to consult their tax advisors concerning the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax considerations arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or any applicable tax treaties, and the possible effect of changes in applicable tax law. </div><div class="BRDSX_h2" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 15pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">U.S. Holders </div><div class="BRDSX_h3" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 7pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">Distributions </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Distributions made to U.S. holders with respect to the Preferred Stock will be taxable as dividend income when paid to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent that the amount of a distribution with respect to the Preferred Stock exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the holder&#8217;s adjusted tax basis in the Preferred Stock, and thereafter as capital gain which will be long-term capital gain if the holder&#8217;s holding period for the stock exceeds one year at the time of the distribution. Distributions on the Preferred Stock constituting dividend income paid to a U.S. holder that is an individual generally will be subject to taxation at preferential rates as qualified dividend income, provided applicable holding period requirements are met and certain other conditions are satisfied. Distributions on the Preferred Stock constituting dividend income paid to a U.S. holder that is a corporation generally will qualify for the dividends-received deduction, subject to various limitations and the satisfaction of the applicable holding period requirements. There is no assurance that we will have sufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits to ensure that any of our distributions are treated as dividends such that qualified dividend income or dividends-received deduction treatment may be available. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Dividends that exceed certain thresholds in relation to a corporate U.S. holder&#8217;s tax basis in the Preferred Stock could be characterized as &#8220;extraordinary dividends&#8221; under the Code. If a corporate U.S. holder that has held the Preferred Stock for two years or less before the dividend announcement date receives an extraordinary dividend, the holder generally will be required to reduce its tax basis (but not below zero) in the Preferred Stock with respect to which the dividend was made by the non-taxed portion of the dividend. If the amount of the reduction exceeds the U.S. holder&#8217;s tax basis in the Preferred Stock, the excess is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of the Preferred Stock. A non-corporate U.S. holder that receives an extraordinary dividend could, under certain circumstances, be required to treat any losses on the sale of our Preferred Stock as long-term capital losses to the extent of the extraordinary dividends such U.S. holder receives that qualify for taxation at the preferential rates discussed above. </div><div class="BRDSX_h3" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 15pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">Deemed Distributions on the Preferred Stock </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">The liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock will be subject to adjustment in the manner described in this prospectus supplement, which adjustment may result in an increase in the liquidation preference. Under Section&#160;305 of the Code, U.S. holders may be treated as receiving a deemed dividend on the Preferred Stock upon such an increase in the liquidation preference, although the matter is not clear. In addition, if our board of directors does not declare a distribution on the Preferred Stock in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, the deferred dividend may be treated as an increase in the liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock. Furthermore, if the Preferred Stock is issued at a discount to its liquidation preference or if we can call the SATA Stock at a price above its issue price, it may be subject to rules that require the accrual of such discount or call premium currently over the deemed term of the Preferred Stock as deemed distributions under U.S. tax rules similar to those governing original issue discount for debt instruments. Although the matter is not entirely clear, we believe any such adjustment of liquidation preference in the manner described in this prospectus supplement, such a deferred dividend, such a discount or such call premium should not be treated as giving rise to a deemed distribution on the Preferred Stock, but in light of this uncertainty, the IRS or an applicable withholding agent could take a contrary position. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">We may elect to increase the price at which we may exercise our optional redemption right. See &#8220;Description of Perpetual Preferred Stock&#8212;Optional Redemption.&#8221; It is possible that any such adjustment could be treated as giving rise to a deemed distribution under Section&#160;305 of the Code, with the likelihood of such treatment depending on the circumstances existing at the time the redemption price is adjusted.

The capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder&#8217;s holding period for the stock exceeds one year at the time of disposition.

In determining whether any of these tests has been met, a U.S. holder must take into account not only the Preferred Stock and other equity interests in us actually owned by the holder but also other equity interests in us that the holder constructively owns under U.S. federal income tax rules, as well as any rights the holder may have to vote for the election of board members. A U.S. holder that owns (actually or constructively) only an insubstantial percentage of our total equity interests and that exercises no control or management over our affairs may be entitled to sale or exchange treatment on a redemption of the Preferred Stock if such holder experiences any reduction in its equity interest (taking into account any constructively owned equity interests) as a result of the redemption. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">If a U.S. holder meets none of the alternative tests described above, the redemption will be treated as a distribution subject to the rules described under &#8220;U.S. Holders&#8212;Distributions.&#8221; If a redemption of the Preferred Stock is treated as a distribution that is taxable as a dividend, U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of tax basis in the redeemed and remaining shares of Preferred Stock. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests described above is satisfied with respect to any particular U.S. holder of the Preferred Stock will depend upon the facts and circumstances as of the time the determination is made, U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax treatment of a redemption. </div><div class="BRDSX_h2" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 18pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">Non-U.S. Holders </div><div class="BRDSX_h3" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 7pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">Distributions </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Generally, subject to the discussions below under &#8220;Information Reporting and Backup Withholding&#8221; and &#8220;FATCA,&#8221; distributions treated as dividends, as described above under &#8220;U.S. Holders&#8212;Distributions,&#8221; paid to a non-U.S. holder with respect to the Preferred Stock that are not effectively connected with the holder&#8217;s conduct of a trade or business within the United States will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty provided the non-U.S. holder furnishes to the withholding agent a properly executed IRS Form&#160;W-8BEN or Form&#160;W-8BEN-E (or suitable substitute form) certifying that such holder is eligible for treaty benefits.

If your Preferred Stock trades under the same CUSIP or other identifying number as that of the other shares of SATA Stock, those other shares may not be distinguishable from your shares by persons such as subsequent purchasers and withholding agents. If we issue or have issued any shares of SATA stock that have a different, and potentially adverse, tax profile or treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes from the Preferred Stock, such profile or treatment could adversely impact the Preferred Stock because of the inability to distinguish between the Preferred Stock and the shares of SATA Stock subject to such adverse treatment. For example, adverse tax treatment of any shares of SATA Stock could negatively impact the trading price of all shares of SATA Stock in light of fungible trading of all such shares. In addition, the IRS could treat a holder of the Preferred Stock as subject to the adverse tax consequences applicable to the other shares of SATA Stock unless the holder is able to demonstrate that it acquired the Preferred Stock in a specific offering and did not hold such other shares of the SATA Stock that are subject to adverse consequences. Preferred stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding these tax considerations. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Please also review the discussion below under &#8220;Fast-Pay Stock Regulations&#8221; for a discussion about the potential application of those rules to the SATA Stock (including the Additional Shares). </div><div class="BRDSX_h3" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 14.5pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">Extraordinary Dividends </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">If Additional Shares are treated as being issued at a price that exceeds their liquidation preference, such Additional Shares would constitute &#8220;disqualified preferred stock&#8221; for purposes of the extraordinary dividend rules. The liquidation preference of the SATA Stock will be subject to adjustment in the manner described in this prospectus supplement. It is not entirely clear how such an adjustable liquidation preference would be treated for purposes of applying the disqualified preferred stock and the extraordinary dividend rules. However, it is possible that such adjustment may be taken into account for purposes of disqualified preferred stock determination. Even if the Preferred Stock is not issued at such a price, due to fungible trading of Additional Shares with Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock may be considered disqualified preferred stock, unless owners of the Preferred Stock can clearly demonstrate that they purchased the Preferred Stock offered hereby as opposed to such Additional Shares. If the Preferred Stock held by a corporate U.S.&#160;holder were considered disqualified preferred stock (because such shares are indistinguishable from the Additional Shares), for any dividend received, the holder generally would be required to reduce its tax basis (but not below zero) in the Preferred Stock with respect to which the dividend is received by the non-taxed portion of the dividend. Please also review the discussion above under &#8220;U.S. Holders&#8212;Distributions&#8221; for a discussion of extraordinary dividends. </div><div class="BRDSX_h3" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 14.5pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">Sales at a Discount </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">As discussed above under &#8220;U.S. Holders&#8212;Deemed Distributions on the Preferred Stock,&#8221; if the Additional Shares are sold at a discount (or at a discount that exceeds the discount that applies to the Preferred Stock at issuance), such Additional Shares may be subject to rules that require the accrual of such discount (or such greater discount) currently over the deemed term of the Additional Shares as deemed distributions under U.S. tax rules similar to those governing original issue discount for debt instruments. Due to fungible trading of Additional Shares with Preferred Stock, the IRS or a withholding agent may treat any such discount as resulting in deemed distributions with respect to the Preferred Stock as well as such Additional Shares. Because any such deemed distributions received by a holder would not give rise to any cash from which any applicable withholding could be satisfied, we (or an applicable withholding agent) may, at our option, set off such payments against, or withhold such taxes from, payments of cash payable to the holder or sales proceeds received by, or other funds or assets of, the holder, or require alternative arrangements in respect of such withholding taxes. </div><div class="BRDSX_h2" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 15pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">Fast-Pay Stock Regulations </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Under Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section&#160;7701(l) of the Code (the &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold;">Fast-Pay Stock Regulations</font>&#8221;), if stock of a corporation is structured such that dividends paid with respect to the stock are economically (in whole or in part) a return of the stockholder&#8217;s investment (rather than a return on the stockholder&#8217;s investment), then the stock is characterized as &#8220;fast-pay stock&#8221; and is subject to adverse tax reporting requirements and potentially penalties, as described below. In addition, under the Fast-Pay Stock Regulations, unless clearly demonstrated otherwise, stock is presumed to be fast-pay stock if it is structured to have a dividend that is reasonably expected to decline (as opposed to a dividend rate that is reasonably expected to fluctuate or remain constant) (for such purpose, the dividend rate may be viewed as reasonably expected to decline if we are reasonably expected to stop paying regular </div></div></div><div class="BRDSX_block-frill" style="width: 468pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-left: 0pt;"><div class="BRDSX_unknown" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 9.47pt; text-align: center;">S-51<br></div></div></div>

It is not clear what amount would constitute &#8220;de minimis&#8221; in the case of stock with a perpetual term. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">The determination of whether stock is fast-pay stock is based on all the facts and circumstances. To determine if it is fast-pay stock, stock is examined when issued, and, for stock that is not fast-pay stock when issued, when there is a significant modification in the terms of the stock or the related agreements or a significant change in the relevant facts and circumstances. The relevant tax regulations do not indicate the types of significant changes in facts and circumstances that are intended to give rise to such a determination, and therefore it is possible that such a change could arise when, for example, there is a change to the terms of our optional redemption right. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: left;">We do not believe that the Preferred Stock (or any SATA Stock we have previously issued) is fast-pay stock. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">We also do not intend to issue any Additional Shares that would be treated as fast-pay stock. Moreover, we intend to obtain advice of counsel in connection with future offerings of Additional Shares for the purpose of analyzing the consequences of issuing such Additional Shares in light of any legal developments regarding the definition of fast-pay stock. As the liquidation preference of the SATA Stock will be subject to adjustment in the manner described in this prospectus supplement and our current intention is to issue any Additional Shares at a price per share not more than $105&#160;plus accrued and unpaid dividends that may apply to such instrument at the time of its issuance, it is generally not expected that the Additional Shares would be issued at such a level of premium above their liquidation preference or optional redemption price at the time of sale of the Additional Shares so as to implicate the fast-pay stock rules. In addition, we do not intend to adjust the regular dividend rate in a manner that would cause the SATA Stock to be treated as fast-pay stock. Any adjustment to the regular dividend rate is expected to be consistent with our current intention to maintain a long-term trading level for the SATA Stock between $95 and $105 per share, and therefore the SATA Stock&#8217;s dividend rate is generally expected to fluctuate over time. Nonetheless, there may be increased risk that the IRS could assert that such Additional Shares constitute fast-pay stock. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Transactions involving fast-pay stock arrangements are treated as &#8220;listed transactions&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Issuers and holders of any shares of fast-pay stock would be required to report their participation in the transaction on IRS Form&#160;8886 on an annual basis with their U.S. federal income tax returns and would also be required to mail a copy of that form to the IRS Office of Tax Shelter Analysis. Failure to comply with those disclosure requirements could result in the assessment by the IRS of interest, additions to tax and onerous penalties. In addition, an accuracy-related penalty applies under the Code to any reportable transaction understatement attributable to a listed transaction if a significant purpose of the transaction is the avoidance or evasion of U.S. federal income tax. Furthermore, certain material advisors would also be required to file a disclosure statement with the IRS. If we determine that we are required to file an IRS Form&#160;8886 (including a protective filing) in connection with the potential issuance of fast-pay stock with respect to the Preferred Stock or Additional Shares, we intend to provide public notice to the holders of the Preferred Stock or Additional Shares, as applicable, which notice may be by a press release, by publication on our investor relations website, or by filing a current report on Form&#160;8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding our intent not to issue Additional Shares that would be fast-pay stock, the rules regarding the definition of fast-pay stock are unclear in certain respects and, therefore, the IRS could disagree with our determination and treat such Additional Shares as fast-pay stock. In addition, as discussed above under &#8220;&#8212;Multiple Issuances of SATA Stock &#8211; Effect of Fungible Trading,&#8221; even though we believe that the Preferred Stock offered hereby is not treated as fast-pay stock, the treatment of any Additional Shares as fast-pay stock could affect the Preferred Stock if all such shares are indistinguishable because they have the same CUSIP or other identifying number. For example, if the IRS treated such Additional Shares as fast-pay stock, a holder of the Preferred Stock might be required to demonstrate to the IRS that the holder purchased the Preferred Stock as opposed to such Additional Shares. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Furthermore, treatment of such Additional Shares as fast-pay stock could adversely affect the trading price of the Preferred Stock.

Under Rule&#160;15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally must settle in one business day, unless the parties to the trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade SATA Stock before the business day before the settlement date must, because the SATA Stock initially will settle T+3, specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement.

Upon completion of the above-mentioned merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), Strive, Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker symbol &#8220;ASST&#8221; and consummated its previously announced private offering of Class&#160;A common stock, pre-funded warrants and traditional warrants (&#8220;PIPE Financing&#8221;) and its previously announced exchange of Class&#160;A Common Stock for bitcoin pursuant to Section&#160;351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;351 Exchange&#8221;).

The definition of the term &#8220;combination&#8221; is sufficiently broad to cover most significant transactions between a corporation and an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; These statutes generally apply to Nevada corporations with 200 or more stockholders of record.

In those cases, one or more registered global securities will be issued in a denomination or aggregate denominations equal to the portion of the aggregate principal or face amount of the securities to be represented by registered global securities.

Upon the issuance of a registered global security, the depositary will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the participants&#8217; accounts with the respective principal or face amounts of the securities beneficially owned by the participants. Any dealers, underwriters or agents participating in the distribution of the securities will designate the accounts to be credited. Ownership of beneficial interests in a registered global security will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by the depositary, with respect to interests of participants, and on the records of participants, with respect to interests of persons holding through participants. The laws of some states may require that some purchasers of securities take physical delivery of these securities in definitive form. These laws may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in registered global securities. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">So long as the depositary, or its nominee, is the registered owner of a registered global security, that depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the securities represented by the registered global security for all purposes under the applicable indenture, warrant agreement, guaranteed trust preferred security or unit agreement. Except as described below, owners of beneficial interests in a registered global security will not be entitled to have the securities represented by the registered global security registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the securities in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the securities under the applicable indenture, warrant agreement, guaranteed trust preferred security or unit agreement. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a registered global security must rely on the procedures of the depositary for that registered global security and, if that person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which the person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the applicable indenture, warrant agreement, guaranteed trust preferred security or unit agreement. We understand that under existing industry practices, if we request any action of holders or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a registered global security desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the applicable indenture, warrant agreement, guaranteed trust preferred security or unit agreement, the depositary for the registered global security would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take that action, and the participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through them to give or take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners holding through them. </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">Principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on debt securities, and any payments to holders with respect to warrants, guaranteed trust preferred securities or units, represented by a registered global security registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee will be made to the depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner </div></div></div><div class="BRDSX_block-frill" style="width: 468pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-left: 0pt;"><div class="BRDSX_unknown" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 9.47pt; text-align: center;">25<br></div></div></div>

Any securities issued in definitive form in exchange for a registered global security will be registered in the name or names that the depositary gives to the relevant trustee, warrant agent, unit agent or other relevant agent of ours or theirs.

We will describe in the applicable prospectus supplement how any auction or bidding process will be conducted to determine the price or any other terms of the securities, how potential investors may participate in the process and, where applicable, the nature of the obligations of any agent, underwriter, dealer, direct sales or remarketing firm with respect to the auction or ordering system. </div><div class="BRDSX_h2" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 14.5pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-align: left;">Derivative Transactions and Hedging </div><div class="BRDSX_para" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0pt; text-indent: 20pt; text-align: justify;">We may enter into derivative or other hedging transactions involving the securities with third parties, or sell securities not covered by the prospectus to third parties in privately-negotiated transactions.

If so, the third party may use securities pledged by us or borrowed from us or others to settle those sales or to close out any related open borrowings of securities, and may use securities received from us in settlement of those derivative or hedging transactions to close out any related open borrowings of securities.

Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which create a short position. This short sales position may involve either &#8220;covered&#8221; short sales or &#8220;naked&#8221; short sales. Covered short sales are short sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters&#8217; over-allotment option to purchase additional securities in an offering. The underwriters may close out any covered short position either by exercising their over-allotment option or by purchasing securities in the open market. To determine how they will close the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of securities available for purchase in the open market, as compared to the price at which they may purchase securities through the over-allotment option. Naked short sales are short sales in excess of the over-allotment option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing securities in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if </div></div></div><div class="BRDSX_block-frill" style="width: 468pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-left: 0pt;"><div class="BRDSX_unknown" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 9.47pt; text-align: center;">28<br></div></div></div>

Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security for the purpose of fixing the price of the security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
