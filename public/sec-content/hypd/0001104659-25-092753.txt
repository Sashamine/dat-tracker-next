 &ldquo;amendment no. 1&rdquo;) amends the prospectus supplement dated December 30, 2024 (the &ldquo;original prospectus supplement&rdquo;).
This amendment no. 1 should be read in conjunction with the original prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, dated October
8, 2024 (the &ldquo;accompanying prospectus&rdquo;), each of which are to be delivered with this amendment no. 1, and is qualified by
reference thereto, except to the extent that this amendment no. 1 contains information that is different from or in addition to the information

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">On December 30, 2024, we entered into the Amended
and Restated Sales Agreement (the &ldquo;Original Sales Agreement&rdquo;) with Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (&ldquo;Chardan&rdquo;), relating
to the sale of shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, offered by the original prospectus supplement and the accompanying
prospectus. On September 24, 2025, we entered into an amendment to the Original Sales Agreement (the &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo; and together
with the Original Sales Agreement, the &ldquo;Sales Agreement&rdquo;) to increase the aggregate offering price of our common stock we
may offer and sell pursuant to the Sales Agreement from up to $50,000,000 to up to $100,000,000. We are filing this amendment no. 1 to
the original prospectus supplement to increase the aggregate dollar amount of shares of common stock that we may sell in accordance with
the Sales Agreement. The original prospectus supplement authorized us to offer and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering
price of up to $33,586,557. As of the date of this amendment no. 1, we have offered and sold 4,176,196 shares of our common stock pursuant
to the Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of $28,996,998. This amendment no. 1 is increasing the dollar amount of common stock available
to be sold from time to time hereunder to $60,225,987, which consists of $4,589,559 remaining as originally authorized under the original
prospectus supplement and an additional $55,636,248, from and including the date hereof.</P>

securities, but will act as our sales agent using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices,
on mutually agreed terms between Chardan and us. There is no arrangement for funds to be received in any escrow, trust or similar arrangement.</P>

stock will be 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any common stock sold under the Sales Agreement. See &ldquo;Plan of Distribution&rdquo; beginning
on page&nbsp;S-14&nbsp;of this amendment no. 1 for additional information regarding the compensation to be paid to Chardan. In
connection with the sale of the common stock on our behalf, Chardan will be deemed to be an &ldquo;underwriter&rdquo; within the meaning
of the&nbsp;Securities Act&nbsp;and the compensation of Chardan will be deemed to be underwriting commissions. We have also agreed to
provide indemnification and contribution to Chardan with respect to certain liabilities, including liabilities under the&nbsp;Securities

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">On HyperCore, users start by funding their non-custodial
accounts with deposits of USD Coin, a centralized cryptocurrency that is linked to the US dollar (&ldquo;USDC&rdquo;). The available USDC
can be withdrawn at any time. Users can use their funds to purchase or sell spot token assets, or enter into a perpetuals trade on their
desired token asset, with near-instant settlement. Hyperliquid supports non-custodial trading via its performant HyperCore order books,
with spot and/or perpetual futures trading for a range of digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL)
and Sui (SUI) driving its utilization. Both type of transactions can be entered or exited at any time, with the users&rsquo; confirmation.
When transactions are executed on HyperCore, they are recorded and settled in the order they were placed, and they are not reported to
a broker-dealer or alternative trading system (ATS), as execution is fully managed onchain and there is no offering being made that requires
a specific &ldquo;lifecycle&rdquo; for user onboarding, registration or settlement. The &ldquo;lifecycle&rdquo; of a transaction on HyperCore
may be viewed as the duration of a user entering and exiting a trade.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract
that are blockchain-enabled and allows users to speculate on the price of an asset without owning the underlying asset itself. Unlike
traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures have no expiration date, allowing users to hold positions indefinitely as long as they
meet margin requirements. Hyperliquid utilizes a traditional order book system. This approach allows users to place bids and asks for
various assets, more akin to a centralized cryptocurrency exchange than other decentralized exchanges that rely on automated market makers
to fulfill orders. The Hyperliquid blockchain is available to any potential user with a compatible cryptocurrency wallet such as MetaMask,
Phantom, and Coinbase Wallet. However, Hyperliquid interface operators can choose to block persons in certain jurisdictions or sanctioned
wallets as required via solutions such as geoblocking and address screening.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">If desired, users can also transfer their assets
to HyperEVM. On HyperEVM, a user can similarly swap, lend and borrow against their self-custodied assets on various Hyperliquid compatible
smart-contract applications, with near-instant settlement. The lifecycle of a transaction varies here, as it is dependent on the user&rsquo;s
intent with using various smart contract applications.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">HYPE is the native token of Hyperliquid. On both
HyperCore and HyperEVM, users can purchase the HYPE token. HYPE is also available through other platforms such as Binance US, Gate.io
and Kucoin, and it is not the only spot asset available on the Hyperliquid network (e.g. BTC, ETH, and SOL are also available on the Hyperliquid
network). The total supply of HYPE is 1 billion, with 31% of the supply being issued in November 2024. 38.88% of the total supply was
reserved for future community emissions. As of September 10, 2025, 31.3% of the supply of HYPE, which was reported on DefiLlama to be
approximately 313,2700,000, was circulating. The next major unlock event for the HYPE token will begin on November 29, 2025 with the unlock
of approximately 9,920,000 HYPE tokens on a monthly basis for the core contributors, totaling up to approximately 238 million HYPE tokens
over two years. HYPE serves multiple purposes: users can stake HYPE to reduce their trading fees, use it to conduct transactions on the
HyperEVM, and even use it as collateral on various DeFi applications. In addition, Hyperliquid has a unique network mechanism that autonomously
purchases and removes HYPE tokens from circulation. This is done by using the trading fees generated on the network&rsquo;s order books
to buy back available HYPE: approximately 97% of daily fees are allocated to this mechanism, which serves as a consistent &ldquo;marginal
buyer&rdquo; for the token. As of September 2025, more than 30 million HYPE has been removed from circulation and the token has become
the 15th-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Additionally, HYPE has certain governance rights
with respect to the Hyperliquid blockchain. The Hyperliquid L1 is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, wherein validators that have staked the
threshold number of HYPE are selected to produce blocks and will receive rewards when they successfully validate blocks. Holders of HYPE
can delegate to validators who then are able to vote on certain decisions regarding the platform, such as the listing and de-listing of
new markets. Any holder of HYPE can delegate HYPE to a validator to earn staking rewards, should the validator successfully participate
in network consensus. To delegate HYPE to a validator, holders of HYPE must transfer their HYPE from their &ldquo;spot balance&rdquo;
to the &ldquo;staking balance&rdquo;. Unstaking staked HYPE and transferring it back from the &ldquo;staking balance&rdquo; to the &ldquo;spot
balance&rdquo; requires a 7-day unlocking period. As of June 30, 2025, none of our HYPE holdings were staked. The Company initialized
the staking process on July 1, 2025, and as of September 10, 2025, it had 1,218,524.48 HYPE staked directly to the Kinetiq x Hyperion
validator, described further below.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">As part of its broader onchain engagement strategy,
the Company recently announced a co-branded Hyperliquid validator, Kinetiq x Hyperion, with Kinetiq, a liquid staking protocol built natively
for the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Validator operations are further supported by infrastructure provided by Pier Two, an institutional staking
services provider. We are currently in the process of finalizing a definitive co-validator agreement with Kinetiq and Pier Two, pursuant
to which we will pay a percentage of validator commissions to each of Kinetiq and Pier Two. Kinetiq will provide validator operations
support and infrastructure coordination while Pier Two will provide hosting and technical support services for the validator node. By
running our own validator, the Company can directly access HYPE staking yield in addition to supporting Hyperliquid&rsquo;s network stability
and security. Staked HYPE can be delegated to user accounts which reduces their trading fees or increases the revenue share from referring
new users, both of which could serve as revenue opportunities for the Company. Specifically, the validator potentially enables the Company
to create unique financial products built around the demand for these network benefits from those who do not have access to HYPE.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">HYPE can also be deployed into the HyperEVM for
various strategies such as lending and liquidity provisioning. This is expected to enable the Company to support various applications
built on Hyperliquid and in return, potentially earn yield that can be compounded into its overall HYPE acquisition strategy.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Anchorage Digital Bank National Association (&ldquo;Anchorage
Digital&rdquo;), which recently rolled out full support asset custody on HyperEVM, provides custody and trade execution services for HYPE.
Anchorage Digital is the only federally chartered cryptocurrency bank in the United States, serves as a custodian for digital assets,
and is licensed and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Anchorage Digital has institutional-grade security required
by institutional investors and employs HSM (Hardware Security Module) for a unique security model for security digital assets. Anchorage
Digital&rsquo;s public support for Hyperliquid by prioritizing development of infrastructure uniquely for Hyperliquid is a testament to
the future prospect of the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Currently, Anchorage Digital provides only custodial services to the Company and does
not use a sub-custodian.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">By prudently building and deploying a treasury
of HYPE, the Company believes that it can rapidly accelerate the growth of the Hyperliquid ecosystem and further its adoption, potentially
creating a powerful flywheel effect that may drive platform usage, increase protocol value and strengthen the long-term position of both
the Hyperliquid ecosystem and the Company.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Hyperion DeFi is also developing the proprietary
Optejet User Filled Device (the &ldquo;Optejet UFD&rdquo;) that is designed to work with a variety of topical ophthalmic liquids, including
artificial tears and lens rewetting products. The Optejet UFD is especially useful in chronic front-of-the-eye diseases due to its ease
of use, enhanced safety and tolerability, and potential for superior compliance versus standard eye drops. Together, these benefits may
result in higher treatment compliance and better outcomes for patients and providers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The ergonomic and functional design of the Optejet
UFD allows for horizontal drug delivery and eliminates the need to tilt the head back or the manual dexterity to squeeze a bottle to administer
medications. Drug is delivered in a microscopic array of droplets that is comfortable and matches the amount of fluid that the front of
the eye can hold. The precise delivery of a low-volume columnar spray by the Optejet UFD helps ensure instillation success while minimizing
contamination risk with a non-protruding nozzle and self-closing shutter. In clinical trials, the Optejet UFD has demonstrated that its
targeted delivery achieves a high rate of successful administration, with 98% of sprays being accurately delivered upon first attempt
compared to the established rate reported with traditional eye drops of approximately 50%.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">A more physiologically appropriate volume of medication
in the range of seven to ten microliters is delivered by the Optejet UFD, which is approximately one-fifth of the 35 to 50 microliter
dose typically delivered in a single eye drop. Lower volume of medication exposes the ocular surface to less active ingredients and preservatives,
potentially reducing ocular stress and surface damage and improving tolerability. The lower volume also minimizes the potential for drug
to enter systemic circulation, with the goal of avoiding some common side effects that are related to overdosing of the eye.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We anticipate registering the second generation
of the Optejet UFD as a liquid drug delivery device, based on our experience with MydCombi&reg;. MydCombi was the only Food and Drug Administration-approved
fixed combination of the two leading mydriatic agents, tropicamide and phenylephrine, in the United States delivered with technology that
is nearly identical to the first generation of the Optejet UFD.</P>

superior to those of our then existing securityholders, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting
power of shares of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, the holders of these debt securities would
similarly have some rights senior to those of our then existing securityholders, and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity
securities and the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected if we are delisted from Nasdaq or if we are unable to transfer
our listing to another stock market. On September&nbsp;18, 2024, we were notified by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the &ldquo;Nasdaq Stock
Market&rdquo;) that we were in breach of Listing Rule&nbsp;5550(a)(2) (the &ldquo;Minimum Bid Price Requirement&rdquo;), for continued
listing on Nasdaq because the minimum bid price of our listed securities for 30 consecutive business days had been less than $1 per share.
On December&nbsp;12, 2024, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market notifying us that, because the closing bid price for our
common stock was below $0.10 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, we were in breach of Listing Rule&nbsp;5810(c)(3)(A)(iii). On
January&nbsp;31, 2025, we executed an 80-for-1 reverse stock split, following which we were notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market that we
had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rule&nbsp;5810(c)(3)(A)(iv)&nbsp;states that
any listed company that fails to meet the Minimum Bid Price Requirement&nbsp;and has effected a reverse stock split over the prior one-year
period, or has effected one or more reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more
to one, will not be eligible for an automatic 180-day grace compliance period and the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department is obligated
to immediately issue a delisting determination. Therefore, if we were to fall out of compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement
prior to January&nbsp;31, 2026, we would not be able to effect a reverse stock split and would immediately be issued a delisting determination.</P>

Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2024 was below the Minimum Equity Requirement. On September 2, 2025, we

Bid Price Requirement and the Minimum Equity Requirement, there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy those or any other
continued listing requirements and maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq. If our common stock is delisted by the Nasdaq Stock
Market, it could lead to a number of negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, deterring broker-dealers
from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common stock, increased volatility in our common stock, reduced
liquidity in our common stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws and greater difficulty in obtaining financing.
Delisting could also cause a loss of confidence of our customers, collaborators, vendors, suppliers and employees, which could harm our
business and future prospects.</P>

Market, the price of our common stock may decline, and although our common stock may be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, another
over-the-counter quotation system, or on the pink sheets, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of their common stock or obtain
accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, trading in our securities
may be subject to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules. These &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules&nbsp;will require brokers trading
in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules&nbsp;and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary
trading market for our common stock. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements may discourage broker-dealers
from recommending transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the liquidity of our securities and consequently adversely
affect the market price for our securities.</P>

Agreement (as defined herein). We expect to continue to incur cash outflows from operations for the near future. Implementation of our

to fund our operations, any required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, due to a variety of factors,
including volatile conditions in the economy and capital markets, due to inflation, questions about bank stability and other factors.
If we are unsuccessful in our operations to secure additional financing, or if any such incremental financing is not sufficient to fund
our operations, we may be required to take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash.</P>

shares of our common stock in this offering in the aggregate amount of $60,225,987, at an assumed public offering price of $10.16 per
share of common stock, the last reported sale price of our common stock on Nasdaq on September 22, 2025, and after deducting the fees
of Chardan and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of June 30, 2025 would
have been approximately $72.0 million, or $5.58 per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma as adjusted net tangible
book value of $3.62 per share to existing stockholders and immediate dilution of $4.58 per share to new investors in this offering at
the offering price. The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis. The pro forma as adjusted information is illustrative
only and will adjust based on the actual price to the public, the actual number of shares sold and other terms of the offering determined
at the time shares of our common stock are sold pursuant to this amendment no. 1. The shares sold in this offering, if any, will be sold
from time to time at various prices. We will not offer and sell shares that would result in a number of outstanding shares that exceeds
our total authorized amount of shares of common stock under our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, which
is 600,000,000 shares as of the date of this amendment no. 1.</P>

pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100,000,000 from time to time
through Chardan as our sales agent. The Amendment amended the Original Sales Agreement in order to, among other things, increase the aggregate
offering price from up to $50,000,000 to up to $100,000,000. As of the date of this prospectus supplement amendment no. 1, we have offered
and sold 4,176,196 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of $28,996,998. Up to $60,225,987 of
shares of common stock may be sold pursuant to this amendment no. 1 through Chardan as our sales agent. Sales of shares of common stock,
if any, under this amendment no. 1 will be made at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an &ldquo;at-the-market&rdquo; offering,
as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on Nasdaq or any other trading market for our common stock.
If authorized by us in writing, Chardan may purchase shares of our common stock as principal.</P>

to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement on a daily basis or as otherwise agreed upon by us and Chardan. We will designate the
maximum amount of common stock to be sold through Chardan on a daily basis or otherwise determine such maximum amount together with Chardan.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Chardan will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal
trading and sales practices to sell on our behalf all of the shares of common stock requested to be sold by us. We may instruct Chardan
not to sell shares of common stock if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by us in any such instruction. Chardan
or we may suspend the offering of shares of our common stock being made through Chardan under the Sales Agreement upon proper notice to
the other party. Chardan and we each have the right, by giving written notice as specified in the Sales Agreement, to terminate the Sales
Agreement in each party&rsquo;s sole discretion at any time. The offering of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement
will otherwise terminate upon the termination of the Sales Agreement as provided therein.</P>

the Sales Agreement. We have also agreed to reimburse Chardan for certain ongoing fees of its legal counsel. We estimate that the total
expenses of the offering payable by us, excluding commissions and reimbursable expenses payable to Chardan under the Sales Agreement,
