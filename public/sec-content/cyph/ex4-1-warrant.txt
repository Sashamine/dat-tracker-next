the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock,

anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not effect the exercise of any portion of this Warrant, and the Holder of
this Warrant shall not exercise any portion of the Warrant, and any such exercise shall be null and void ab initio and treated as if the
exercise had not been made, to the extent that immediately prior to or following such exercise, the Holder, together with the Attribution
Parties, beneficially owns or would beneficially own as determined in accordance with Section&nbsp;13(d)&nbsp;of the Exchange Act and
the rules&nbsp;promulgated thereunder, in excess of [4.99%/9.99%/19.99%] (the &ldquo;<B>Maximum Percentage</B>&rdquo;) of the Common Stock
that would be issued and outstanding following such exercise. For purposes of calculating beneficial ownership for determining whether
the Maximum Percentage is or will be exceeded, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock held and/or beneficially owned by the Holder
together with the Attribution Parties, shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held and/or beneficially owned by the Holder
together with the Attribution Parties plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the relevant Warrant with respect
to which the determination is being made but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i)&nbsp;exercise
of the remaining, unexercised Warrant held and/or beneficially owned by the Holder or the Attribution Parties and (ii)&nbsp;exercise or
conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company held and/or beneficially owned by such Holder
or any Attribution Party (including, without limitation, any convertible notes, convertible stock or warrants) that are subject to a limitation
on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein. For purposes of this <U>Paragraph 11(a)</U>, beneficial ownership
of the Holder or the Attribution Parties shall, except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, be calculated and determined
in accordance with Section&nbsp;13(d)&nbsp;of the Exchange Act and the rules&nbsp;promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Warrant,
in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder of this Warrant may rely on the number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock as reflected in (1)&nbsp;the Company&rsquo;s most recent Form&nbsp;10-K, Form&nbsp;10-Q, Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K
or other public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the case may be, (2)&nbsp;a more recent public announcement by
the Company or (3)&nbsp;any other notice by the Company or the Company&rsquo;s transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding (such issued and outstanding shares, the &ldquo;<B>Reported Outstanding Share Number</B>&rdquo;). For any reason at
any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing or by
electronic mail to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. The Holder shall disclose to the Company the number
of shares of Common Stock that it, together with the Attribution Parties holds and/or beneficially owns and has the right to acquire through
the exercise of derivative securities and any limitations on exercise or conversion analogous to the limitation contained herein contemporaneously
or immediately prior to submitting an Exercise Notice for the relevant Warrant. If the Company receives an Exercise Notice from the Holder
at a time when the actual number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company
shall (i)&nbsp;notify the Holder in writing of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Exercise
Notice would otherwise cause the Holder&rsquo;s, together with the Attribution Parties&rsquo;, beneficial ownership, as determined pursuant
to this <U>Section&nbsp;11(a)</U>, to exceed the Maximum Percentage, the Holder must notify the Company of a reduced number of Warrant
Shares to be purchased pursuant to such Exercise Notice (the number of shares by which such purchase is reduced, the &ldquo;<B>Reduction
Shares</B>&rdquo;) and (ii)&nbsp;as soon as reasonably practicable, the Company shall return to the Holder any exercise price paid by
the Holder for the Reduction Shares. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect
to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder and the Attribution Parties since the
date as of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported. In the event that the issuance of Common Stock to the Holder upon
exercise of this Warrant results in the Holder, together with the Attribution Parties, being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate,
more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (as determined under Section&nbsp;13(d)&nbsp;of the
Exchange Act), the number of shares so issued by which the Holder&rsquo;s, together with the Attribution Parties&rsquo;, aggregate beneficial
ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the &ldquo;<B>Excess Shares</B>&rdquo;) shall be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled
ab initio, and the Holder and/or the Attribution Parties shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess Shares. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the issuance of the Excess Shares has been deemed null and void, the Company shall return to the Holder the
exercise price paid by the Holder for the Excess Shares. By written notice to the Company, a Holder of this Warrant may from time to time
increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 19.99% specified in such notice; provided that any
increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company and shall not
negatively affect any partial exercise effected prior to such change.</P>
