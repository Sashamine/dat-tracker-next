____________________________

(1)  Except as otherwise indicated, the number of shares beneficially owned is
     determined under rules promulgated by the SEC, and the information is not
     necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose.  The
     selling stockholder has sole voting power and investment power with respect
     to all shares listed as owned by the selling

<PAGE>

     stockholder. The selling stockholder does not own any shares of the class B
     common stock of MicroStrategy.

(2)  Includes 40,996 shares of our class A common stock issuable as dividends
     through July 1, 2001 on our series A preferred stock in lieu of cash, and
     2,536,913 shares of class A common stock issuable to the selling
     stockholders upon conversion of the shares of our series A convertible
     preferred stock and series B convertible preferred stock held by the
     selling stockholder. Under the certificates of designations for the series
     A convertible preferred stock and the series B convertible preferred stock,
     the selling stockholder may not convert preferred shares to the extent such
     conversion or exercise would cause the selling stockholder, together with
     its affiliates, to have acquired a number of shares of class A common stock
     during the 60-day period ending on the date of conversion which, when added
     to the number of shares of class A common stock held at the beginning of
     such 60-day period, would exceed 9.99% of our then outstanding class A
     common stock, excluding for purposes of such determination shares of class
     A common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred shares which have
     not been converted. The number of shares in the second column does not
     reflect this limitation.

(3)  Includes 4,703,592 shares of our class A common stock issued or issuable to
     the selling stockholder upon conversion of the series A convertible
     preferred stock held by the selling stockholder or as dividends on such
     series A convertible preferred stock in lieu of cash, and gives effect to
     the sale pursuant to the prospectus prior to July 5, 2001 of a total of
     709,383 shares of our class A common stock issued to all the selling
     stockholders named in the prospectus to which this prospectus supplement
     relates. The actual number of shares of our class A common stock offered
     hereby and included in the registration statement of which this prospectus
     is a part includes, as provided by Rule 416 under the Securities Act, such
     additional number of shares of common stock as may be issued or issuable
     upon conversion of our series A convertible preferred stock and as
     dividends on the series A convertible preferred stock to prevent dilution
     resulting from any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction.

(4)  We do not know when or in what amounts the selling stockholder will offer
     shares for sale, if at all. The selling stockholder may sell any or all of
     the shares offered by the prospectus as supplemented hereby. Because the
     selling stockholder may offer all or some of the shares pursuant to this
     offering, and because there are currently no agreements, arrangements or
     understandings with respect to the sale of any of the shares that will be
     held by the selling stockholder after completion of the offering, we cannot
     estimate the number of the shares that will be held by the selling
     stockholders after completion of the offering. However, for purposes of
     this table, we have assumed that, after completion of the offering, none of
     the shares covered by this prospectus will be held by the selling
     stockholder.

(5)  In connection with the refinancing of our series A preferred stock, we have
     filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-64104) relating to
     the resale of an aggregate of 25,563,896 shares of class A common stock
     issued or issuable to the selling
<PAGE>

     stockholders named in that registration statement in respect of the
     exchange of shares of our series A preferred stock for, and upon conversion
     of, shares of our series B preferred stock, series C preferred stock,
     series D preferred stock and series E preferred stock, and in payment of
     dividends on our series B preferred stock and series C preferred stock in
     lieu of cash. As of July 5, 2001, after giving effect to the offerings
     described in this prospectus and in the registration statement relating to
     the refinancing, the selling stockholder would beneficially own no shares
     of our class A common stock.

(6)  Calculated based on 36,807,527 shares of class A common stock outstanding
     as of June 30, 2001.

(7)  Promethean Asset Management, LLC, a New York limited liability company,
     serves as investment manager to HFTP Investment L.L.C. and may be deemed to
     share beneficial ownership of the shares beneficially owned by HFTP by
     reason of shared power to vote and to dispose of the shares beneficially
     owned by HFTP. Promethean disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares
     beneficially owned by HFTP. Mr. James F. O'Brien, Jr. indirectly controls
     Promethean. Mr. O'Brien disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares
     beneficially owned by Promethean and HFTP. HFTP is not a registered broker-
     dealer. HFTP, however, is under common control with, and therefore an
     affiliate of, a registered broker-dealer.
