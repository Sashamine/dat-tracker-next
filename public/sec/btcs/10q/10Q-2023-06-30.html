in Control</B>&rdquo; means the occurrence, in a single transaction or in a series of related transactions, of any one or more of the
following events: (i) any Exchange Act Person becomes the owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more
than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company&rsquo;s then outstanding securities other than by virtue of a merger, consolidation
or similar transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control will not be deemed to occur (A) on account of the acquisition
of securities of the Company directly from the Company, (B) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company by an investor,
any affiliate thereof or any other Exchange Act Person that acquires the Company&rsquo;s securities in a transaction or series of related
transactions the primary purpose of which is to obtain financing for the Company through the issuance of equity securities, (C) on account
of the acquisition of securities of the Company by any individual who is either an executive officer or a Director; or (D) solely because
the level of ownership held by any Exchange Act Person (the &ldquo;<B>Subject Person</B>&rdquo;) exceeds the designated percentage threshold
of the outstanding voting securities as a result of the conversion of another stockholder&rsquo;s voting securities or a repurchase or
other acquisition of voting securities by the Company reducing the number of shares outstanding, provided that if a Change in Control
would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of voting securities by the Company, and after such
share acquisition, the Subject Person becomes the owner of any additional voting securities that, assuming the repurchase or other acquisition
had not occurred, increases the percentage of the then outstanding voting securities owned by the Subject Person over the designated
percentage threshold, then a Change in Control will be deemed to occur; (ii) there is consummated a merger, consolidation or similar
transaction involving (directly or indirectly) the Company and, immediately after the consummation of such merger, consolidation or similar
transaction, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior thereto do not own, directly or indirectly, either (A) outstanding voting
securities representing more than 50% of the combined outstanding voting power of the surviving entity in such merger, consolidation
or similar transaction or (B) more than 50% of the combined outstanding voting power of the parent of the surviving entity in such merger,
consolidation or similar transaction, in each case in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the outstanding voting
securities of the Company immediately prior to such transaction. (iii) there is consummated a sale, lease, exclusive license or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, other than a sale, lease, license
or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries to an entity, more than
50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned by stockholders of the Company in substantially the same
proportions as their ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to such sale, lease, license or
other disposition; or (iv) individuals who, on the date the Plan is adopted by the Board, are Incumbent Directors (the &ldquo;<B>Incumbent
Board</B>&rdquo;) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Board; <I>provided, however</I>, that
if the appointment or election (or nomination for election) of any new Board member was approved or recommended by a majority vote of
the members of the Incumbent Board then still in office, such new member will, for purposes of this Plan, be considered as a member of
the Incumbent Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing definition or any other provision of the Plan, the term Change in Control will not
include a sale of assets, merger or other transaction effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company and
the definition of Change in Control (or any analogous term) in an individual written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and
the Participant will supersede the foregoing definition with respect to Awards subject to such agreement; <I>provided, however</I>, that
if no definition of Change in Control or any analogous term is set forth in such an individual written agreement, the foregoing definition
will apply. To the extent required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have
occurred if such transaction is not also a &ldquo;change in the ownership or effective control of&rdquo; the Company or &ldquo;a change
in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of&rdquo; the Company as determined under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)
(without regard to any alternative definition thereunder). The Board may, in its sole discretion and without a Participant&rsquo;s consent,
amend the definition of &ldquo;Change in Control&rdquo; to conform to the definition of &ldquo;Change in Control&rdquo; under Section
409A of the Code, and the regulations thereunder.</FONT></P>

means any person, including an advisor, who is (i) engaged by the Company or an Affiliate to render consulting or advisory services and
is compensated for such services, or (ii) serving as a member of the board of directors of an Affiliate and is compensated for such services.
However, service solely as a Director, or payment of a fee for such service, will not cause a Director to be considered a &ldquo;Consultant&rdquo;

an Employee, Consultant or Director or a change in the entity for which the Participant renders such service, provided that there is
no interruption or termination of the Participant&rsquo;s service with the Company or an Affiliate, will not terminate a Participant&rsquo;s
Continuous Service; <I>provided, however</I>, that if the entity for which a Participant is rendering services ceases to qualify as an
Affiliate, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, such Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service will be considered to have
terminated on the date such entity ceases to qualify as an Affiliate. To the extent permitted by law, the Committee or the chief executive
officer of the Company, in that party&rsquo;s sole discretion, may determine whether Continuous Service will be considered interrupted
in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Committee or chief executive officer, including sick leave, military leave or
any other personal leave, or (ii) transfers between the Company, an Affiliate, or their successors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
leave of absence will be treated as Continuous Service for purposes of vesting of an Award only to such extent as may be provided in
the Company&rsquo;s leave of absence policy, in the written terms of any leave of absence agreement or policy applicable to the Participant,
or as otherwise required by law. In addition, to the extent required for exemption from or compliance with Section 409A of the Code,
the determination of whether there has been a termination of Continuous Service will be made, and such term will be construed, in a manner
that is consistent with the definition of &ldquo;separation from service&rdquo; as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)

The Board may abolish the Committee at any time and revest in the Board the administration of the Plan. The members of the Committee
shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Board. From time to time, the Board may increase or decrease the size of the Committee,
add additional members to, remove members (with or without cause) from, appoint new members in substitution therefor, and fill vacancies,

of its members and minutes shall be kept of all of its meetings and copies thereof shall be provided to the Board. Subject to the limitations

However, if the Board intends to satisfy such exemption requirements with respect to any insider subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act, the Committee shall be a compensation committee of the Board that at all times consists solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors.
Within the scope of such authority, the Board or the Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board who are
not Non-Employee Directors the authority to grant Awards to eligible persons who are not then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
Nothing herein shall create an inference that an Award is not validly granted under the Plan in the event Awards are granted under the
Plan by a compensation committee of the Board that does not at all times consist solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors.</FONT></P>

Participant identifies for delivery specific shares of Common Stock that have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of attestation
equal to the Option Exercise Price (or portion thereof) and receives a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the difference between
the number of shares thereby purchased and the number of identified attestation shares of Common Stock (a &ldquo;<B>Stock for Stock Exchange</B>&rdquo;);
